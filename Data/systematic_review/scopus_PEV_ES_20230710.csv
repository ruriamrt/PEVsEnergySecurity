The main reason that hinders the spread of fast charging stations is the installation cost, comprising the infrastructure and converter costs. In this article, a multiport DC-DC converter with differential power processing stages is proposed for Electric Vehicle (EV) fast charging stations, which results in a considerable reduction in the cost of using converters while achieving high efficiency. The proposed topology consists of two paths for the power flow (outer and inner loops) for EV battery charging with main and auxiliary DC-DC converters in the outer loop; all the ports are connected in series with the main supply, where the bulk power is being transferred. The main DC-DC converter injects a series voltage to control the power in the outer loop. The auxiliary DC-DC converters are rated at a fractional power that controls the partial power supplied to each port through the inner loops. Thanks to the fractional power processed by the auxiliary converter with the remaining power fed to the battery through the main converter, the proposed architecture enables simultaneous charging of multiple electric vehicles with better efficiency, lower cost, and the capability of providing a fault tolerance feature. A PWM control scheme for the converters to achieve bi-directional power flow in the partially rated DC-DC converters is discussed for the proposed system. Moreover, a practical down-scaled hardware prototype is designed to validate the functionality, control scheme, and effectiveness of the proposed topology in different case studies being investigated. The efficiency of the proposed converter is compared to the conventional configuration. © 2023 by the authors.","DC-DC converters; differential power processing; dual active bridge; EV charging; fast charging; power control","architecture; electric vehicle; hardware; infrastructure; installation; mineral processing; petroleum; power line; security; topology","","","M.

The proper functioning of production depends on energy security and energy policies. It is an object of geopolitics to control a region's production strategically. With the fight against climate change, green energy policies became relevant. In Latin America, the energy supply has various fossil and non-fossil fuels, primarily hydroelectric and alternative renewables. Energy demand is weak for EVs and mass transport vehicles. The energy matrix change process is led by China in Latin America, with a powerful presence through both credits and investments, both in renewable energy generation and the demand for EVs. Generally, she has invested the most money in energy in the world. Theoretically, there is a geopolitical issue as China has stepped into the US “backyard”. The result is that the energy matrix change has implications for domestic taxation, international trade, and inter-American relations.

However, hydrogen supply intermittency significantly reduces the deployment and reliability of this energy resource. Therefore, this work investigates the underground storage of hydrogen in depleted gas reservoirs to avoid seasonal fluctuations in hydrogen supply and assure long-term energy security. The obtained results from molecular simulation (Density Functional Theory) revealed hydrogen is adsorbed physically on calcite (104) and silica (001) surfaces on different adsorption configurations. This conclusion is supported by low adsorption energies (−0.14 eV for calcite and −0.09 for silica) and by Bader charge analysis, which showed no indication of charge transfer. The experimental results illustrated that hydrogen has a very low adsorption affinity toward carbonate and sandstone rocks in the temperature range of 50–100 °C and pressure up to 20 bar. These results show the potential of depleted gas reservoirs to store hydrogen for s is useful in hydrogen recovery as no hydrogen will be adsorbed to the rock surface of conventional gas reservoirs. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Calcite; Density functional theory; Depleted gas reservoirs; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen storage; Molecular simulation","Calcite; Charge transfer; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Gas adsorption; Gases; Hydrogen storage; Molecular structure; Petroleum reservoirs; Silica; Clean energy sources; Density-functional-theory; Depleted gas reservoir; Experimental investigations; Fossil fuel sources; Gas reservoir; Greenhouse emissions; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen supply; Molecular simulations; Density functional theory","Qatar Foundation, QF, (NPRP13S-1231-190009); Qatar National Research Fund, QNRF; Qatar University, QU","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation) for funding through Grant # NPRP13S-1231-190009.

Unlike mobile air conditioning, electric vehicle thermal management systems are responsible for the temperature of both the cabin and the electrical system. This paper discusses how the life cycle climate performance of a thermal management system can be evaluated to reflect its environmental performance and guide the direction of development. The GREEN-EVTM-LCCP model is developed to assess greenhouse gas emissions over the life cycle of the EVTM systems and to standardize the calculation of energy consumption based on vehicle end-of-life mileage. For efficient management and wide temperature coverage, the Amesim simulation platform is centered on refrigerant injection heat pump systems. The results show that urban climate has the greatest impact on the greenhouse gas emissions of thermal management systems at 54.80% in China, followed by refrigerant type, energy efficiency, and driving conditions. Under typical Chinese climate and driving conditions, the thermal management system has a life cycle equivalent emission of 18,664 kg.

Existing public policy reflects this sentiment. Over the last two decades, various government-sponsored policies have been adopted to stimulate EV sales. The most notable – and ubiquitous – of these are procurement incentives. However, the effectiveness of this policy as a pathway to emissions reductions depends on the cost-to-emissions advantage EVs offer over gasoline powered vehicles. Under what conditions is this advantage realized? Using publicly available data, we estimate the precursors – with foci on aggregate mileage and battery longevity - required for EVs to achieve an array of abatement cost thresholds. Our findings are fourfold. First, we illustrate that increased aggregate vehicle utilization – ceteris paribus – decreases implied abatement cost. Second, we find that, after accounting for battery replacements, requisite aggregate utilization for EV-incentive policies to achieve cost parity with alternatives can greatly exceed existing ownership trends, depending on the targeted abatement cost and vehicle ownership period. Third, we document that – owing to their sole emphasis on EV procurement rather than utilization – existing policy fails to accommodate these preconditions. Fourth, we demonstrate that electrical grid decarbonization may be insufficient to produce efficient abatement cost outcomes for EVs.

Not only facing a growing energy demand, but ASEAN also needs to balance its energy trilemma (energy security, energy equity, and energy sustainability). On the other hand, ASEAN countries also acknowledge the need for transitioning into a low-carbon economy to contribute to the global agenda of sustainable development goals 2030. Considering all the challenges, we argue that a comprehensive review of the historical and outlook of the ASEAN energy landscape, as well as national and regional energy policies, is important to investigate the capability of ASEAN Member States (AMS) to accelerate energy transition while securing energy supply. ASEAN has been a net importer of oil since before 2005, with transport accounting for the largest share of oil demand. Measures in the transportation sector need to be taken by the AMS by enhancing their biofuels and electric vehicle developments. The electricity grid can also be more diversified with the integration of renewable energy, considering the region possesses the untapped potential for hydro and solar, among others. Public financing is required to create a supportive environment for the ASEAN energy transition pathway by opening up the path and catalyzing market participation from private businesses.

Following the Presidential Regulation on the Acceleration Program for battery-based EV for Road Transportation in 2019, the Indonesian government provides incentives for the domestic production of EVs. However, as EV technology is relatively new for the domestic automotive industry in Indonesia, it needs to go through stages of development to achieve full readiness in society. This study analyses the key stakeholders’ perceptions of EV industries using the Japanese technology readiness assessment (J-TRA) to better understand the current readiness level of EVs in Indonesia. Primary data are collected through interviews with an EV start-up company, experts in the EV field, government officials in charge of the national EV projects, and EV end-users. Extensive literature related to success stories of EV adoption in other countries was conducted as the basis for this study. The results showed that key stakeholders agree that EV technology has reached a high readiness level in technology development. Most of the stakeholders voted that the readiness bottleneck is commercialization, safety, and integration parameters. Furthermore, an elaborate policy recommendation gathered from both literature reviews and interviews with related stakeholders is presented. © 2021 by the authors.

As the impact of burning fossil fuels on our environment and public health as well as rising in energy demand grows into a global concern, renewable energy plays imperative roles in the transformation. Coupled with low-carbon technologies that are now becoming more efficient and economical, many electricity regulators worldwide decided to embrace small-scale renewable energy called distributed energy resources (DERs) close to demand in order to enhance the traditional electric power grid. Various hybrid DER solutions with battery storage and demand response have been proposed in a microgrid system to improve electrification and the reliability of power system. Furthermore, the cost of renewable electricity generation that has been continuously falling has triggered the fast development of the technologies in the market. With the support of effective policy and regulatory frameworks and innovative business models, renewable energy will be significantly growing to shape energy security. In the future, trading of excess solar electricity on consumers' rooftop or electric vehicle with the neighborhood at a competitive price will be the new way of living. The deployment of peer-to-peer energy trading, virtual power plant, and carbon pricing scheme will be moving forward to drive the uptake of the clean energy technologies for sustainable electricity industry. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

This work develops a system dynamics (SD) model to study the adoption of these novel options for private transport needs in India as a function of technology performance, cost, and other sector specific features. For EVs, expected growth in battery technology and the inconvenience due to lack of charging infrastructure are considered. Since ethanol production sector is still scaling up, model captures the inter-relationships between demand, supply, producer’s profit, and investment in capacity increase. The growth in compressed biogas (CBG) plants and inconvenience due to lack of gas refilling stations are considered for CNG vehicles. For petrol and diesel, the effect of demand on consumer prices and its effect on ownership cost is modelled. A multi-multinominal logit model is used to capture selection of transport option as a function of total ownership costs. Model simulations are performed till 2050, and quantify the adoption trends as well as resulting total greenhouse gas emissions considering life cycle perspective for all the technological options. Simulation results show that E85, EVs and CNG vehicles would constitute 34 % of total private vehicle stock by 2050, resulting in 668.75 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. The targets set by the government for EV adoption and blending rate of ethanol will not be achieved, and significant improvement is costs and infrastructure are needed. Various policy options to improve adoption of new options are explored, identifying the technology development targets.

Many countries have emphasized the research and development activities and placed strict regulations for extensive utilization of electric vehicles (EV). However, increased integration of plug-in EV (PEV) with power networks brings new challenges to the system operator to maintain the system's reliability and power quality. This paper aims to examine how the reliability of a distribution network (DN) is affected due to the increased PEV charging from the grid. The vehicle's charging and load models are developed for this purpose. The concepts have been exemplified in Roy Billinton Test System.

However, the load demand varies from area to area, resulting in the unbalanced load distribution among MGs. With the perfection of charging facilities, electric vehicle (EV) has attracted more consumers in the automobile market. A large number of EVs connected to MGs without coordination may threaten the safe operation of the power grid. Moreover, considering the constraints of economic factors, the number of charging piles in the MG is limited, i.e., the service capacity of MG is limited. Based on this, the impact of service capacity on the load balancing and average user time is studied. The load balancing matching strategy (LBMS) is adopted to lead the EV charging behavior. We find that the larger service capacity means that the load distribution is more balanced and the average user time is shorter. Furthermore, we find the optimal service capacity of the power grid. When the service capacity is more than that, it will no longer improve the system performance and cause the waste of charging facilities.  © 2011 IEEE.","electric vehicle; load balancing matching strategy; Microgrids; service capacity","Charging (batteries); Costs; Electric load management; Electric power distribution; Electric power plant loads; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Vehicle-to-grid; Behavioral science; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Load balancing matching strategy; Load management; Load modeling; Load-Balancing; Matchings; Microgrid; Service capacity; Behavioral research","","","Y.

Rigorous efforts are on to make electric vehicles (EVs) feasible for commercial use in terms of technological advancements and economic viability. Despite being among the top automobile manufacturing countries in the world, the adoption rate of EVs in India has been poor. There is a need to understand the social acceptability and sustainability of EVs. To bridge this gap, the present study identifies the social factors responsible for slow adoption of EVs in India.

EVs are equipped with sensors that maintain a sustainable environment for the betterment of society and enhance human sustainability. However, at the same time, as is the case for any new digital technology, they are susceptible to threats to security and privacy. Recent incidents demonstrate that these sensors have been misused for car and energy theft, financial fraud, data compromise, and have caused severe health and safety problems, amongst other things. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides a first systematic analysis of EV sustainability, digital technologies that enhance sustainability, their potential cybersecurity threats, and corresponding defense. Firstly, three robust taxonomies have been presented to identify the dangers that can affect long-term sustainability domains, including (1) life and well-being, (2) safe environment, and (3) innovation and development. Second, this research measures the impact of cybersecurity threats on EVs and correspondingly to their sustainability goals. Third, it details the extent to which specific security controls can mitigate these threats, thereby allowing for a smooth transition toward secure and sustainable future smart cities. © 2023 by the authors.","automotive cybersecurity; cyber threats; cybersecurity; demand response; EV security; EVs; optimization; smart cities; sustainability; vehicle safety","Crime; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Energy security; Smart city; Sustainable development; Vehicle safety; Automotive cybersecurity; Automotives; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Demand response; Electric vehicle security; Optimisations; Vehicle safety; Vehicle security; Cybersecurity","Aerospace Malaysia Innovation Centre, (AMIC/AM/P02-01); Sheila and Robert Challey Institute for Global Innovation; Universität der Bundeswehr München; North Dakota State University, NDSU; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, UTM, (06G09, 4C089)","Funding text 1: This work was funded by the Aerospace Malaysia Innovation Centre (Project No. AMIC/AM/P02-01: UTM Grant No. 4C089) and the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (Grant No. 06G09).

These concerns are primarily driven by the transportation industry 5.0. Sustainable transportation in the context of Industry 5.0 considers three factors, namely, economic, environmental and social developments, one of which is a conversion to electric vehicles (EVs) as a mode of transportation industry 5.0. Therefore, significant efforts are being exerted to integrate sustainable transportation modelling approaches (ISTMA) for electronic passenger vehicle (EPV) supportive industry 5.0. Selecting the most sustainable ISTMA for EPV in the context of Industry 5.0 is a crucial decision in sustainable transportation industry 5.0 and fell under the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem due to the five fundamental issues, namely, multiple evaluation criteria, the varying priorities of these criteria, the presence of several levels of criteria diminishes the weight of criteria with sub-criteria, criteria trade-offs and data variation. In this paper, a novel ISTMAs for EPV benchmarking that integrates probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set-fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (P-H-FWZIC) and multiplicative multi-objective Optimisation by ratio analysis (MULTIMOORA) methods are proposed on the basis of the established scoring decision matrix. The proposed integrated methods are used in the first stage to establish decision matrices based on the intersection of the sub-levels of criteria with ISTMAs for EPV using feed-forward data presentation and backward scoring process (BSP) procedures, on this basis, a scoring decision matrix based on intersection between the sustainability in the context of Industry 5.0 and other main criteria with ISTMAs for EPV is established. P-H-FWZIC method is used to accomplish multiple functions, including the evaluation of market share (MS) criterion and weighting the criteria. MULTIMOORA method is used to accomplish multiple functions, including the establishing of scoring decision matrix and the benchmarking of ISTMAs for EPV. A total of ISTMAs for EPV are evaluated and benchmarked on the basis of the identified main criteria with respect to sub levels of criteria. According to the P-H-FWZIC results, the Sus (Sustainability) criterion receives the highest priority with weight value of (0.4722), followed by the SS (Supply Side) and DS (Demand Side) criteria with weight values of (0.3667), and (0.1612), respectively. The MULTIMOORA results reveal that ISTMA1, ISTMA7 and ISTMA2 are the top three sustainable approaches for EPV in the context of Industry 5.0. Lastly, the reliability of the integrated MCDM methods is validated and evaluated using sensitivity analysis and the Spearman correlation coefficient test as well as comparison analysis. © 2022 The Author(s)","Electric vehicle; Fuzzy-weighted with zero-inconsistency; Industry 5.0; Multi-criteria decision making; MULTIMOORA; Probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set; Sustainable transportation","","","","M.

In this regard, every country is taking multiple initiatives to increase the use of solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines (WTs) to encourage green energy and reduce carbon emissions. This energy transition is happening at a very rapid pace globally and there is no exception India too. The transformations in the energy sector are happening in India, and in terms of renewable power generation, it lists amonthe g top five countries. The recent setting of the target of high ambition, viz., taking total generation capacity via renewables to 450 gigawatts (GW) by year 2030. Even though its total present capacity is 400 GW. This is done so that the nation can broader climate goals. This transition would take the low- carbon energy sources beyond 60 % of India's total generation, which is above the amount agreed during the Paris Agreement. There are several objectives that are fulfilled by opting and deploying renewable energy sources (RES). These are exponential economic development, increased energy security, rural population's access to energy, and decreasing impact on the climate.

There are three major types of electric vehicles: battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). BEVs and FCEVs produce no tailpipe emissions while PHEVs do when they operate on the internal combustion engine. In addition to direct emissions such as those from tailpipe, life-cycle emissions of EVs also include all emissions related to fuel and vehicle production, processing, distribution, use, and recycling or disposal. The life-cycle emissions depend largely on the mix of electricity generation sources. EVs can significantly reduce emissions where they are used, but may increase emissions from the power plants that generate electrificity for them. The net impact on public health will depend on the changes in air quality and the population at those localities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The vehicles offer improved energy efficiency, enhanced energy security, and reduced foreign exchange expenditure. Incentivizing the uptake of electric vehicles seems to be an obvious policy decision, but there could be unintended consequences. Real-world driving cycles are essential for validating electric-vehicle energy and economic benefits using simulation studies. In drive-cycle methodologies, the microtrip method is the preferred choice for countrywide representation and is ideal for fuel consumption estimations. This paper reports on the first such real-world driving cycle for the Caribbean, specifically Trinidad and Tobago, which is developed using a microtrip construction method with a novel approach to establishing a slope profile. Highway and suburban segments show some distinct characteristics, including relatively high average accelerations and decelerations in the highway and suburban cycles and low average speeds of 40.2 km/h (highway) and 21.74 km/h (suburban).

The central and state governments have announced several incentives/subsidies for electric vehicle adopters, but India's present electric vehicle sales are significantly less than other countries. In the initial stage to improve electric vehicle penetration, the electric bike needs to be given more importance because two-wheelers share more than seventy-nine percent of vehicle numbers on the Indian roads. Thus, this study aims to identify factors that significantly affect the user's willingness to adopt electric bikes and develop a user-mode choice model to shift from a conventional two-wheeler to an electric bike. Also, this study identifies suitable policy options to encourage electric bike use in India. For this purpose, 712 samples were collected from road users in Ahmedabad and used for the analysis. Pearson correlation, Kendall's Tau-b, Spearman's rho correlations, and odds ratio tests were used to study the significant influence of respondents' socio-economic characteristics, travel information, and electric bike attributes on electric bike adoption. The ordered probit model was used to estimate the user's mode shift behavior from a conventional two-wheeler to an electric bike. Further, the Analytic Hierarchy Process method was adopted to prioritize the alternative policies to encourage electric bike adoption. This study finds that gender, travel distance, fuel expenditure, and motivating factors of using electric bikes significantly influences the users' mode shift behavior to adopt electric vehicles. The policy analysis shows that introducing high-speed electric bikes with improved battery technology, road and vehicle tax exemption on electric bike purchases, and providing proper charging facilities are the most preferred policies by the users. Implementing these policies across the country would significantly help reduce the consumer's risk perception of electric bikes and improve electric vehicle adoption in India. © 2022 World Conference on Transport Research Society","Analytical Hierarchy Process; Electric bike; Electric Vehicle Policy; Mode shift; Ordered Probit Model","Ahmedabad; Gujarat; India; analytical hierarchy process; combustion; correlation; electric vehicle; policy analysis; risk perception; socioeconomic conditions","","","M.

This paradigm entails the inclusion of aspects not strictly related to energy exploitation but referring to environmental, social, and economic domains, such as improvement in local energy security, people’s opinion on different energy solutions, economic co-benefits for private users, environmental externalities, and so on. In this domain, it is of particular importance to provide the decision makers with evaluation tools able to consider the complexity of the impacts, thus leading to the choice of the most sustainable solutions. The paper aims to investigate the scientific literature in the context of evaluation frameworks for supporting decision problems related to the energy transition. The review is carried out through the scientific database SCOPUS. The analysis allows for systematizing the contributions according to the main families of evaluation methodologies, discussing to what extent they can be useful in real-world applications. The paper also proposes emerging trends and innovative research lines in the domain of energy planning and urban management. While the energy transition is an important trend, the analysis showed that few studies were conducted on the evaluation of projects, plans, and policies that aim to reach post-carbon targets. The scales of application refer mainly to global or national levels, while few studies have been developed at the district level.

EV diffusion is a complex dynamic system that involves various agent interactions. Nevertheless, previous research has rarely focused on the impact of different policies on EV diffusion under multiagent interactions and thus has not systematically evaluated its diffusion benefits. This paper establishes a multiagent system dynamics (SD) model to explore the impact of different policies on the diffusion and benefits of EVs. The results indicate that (1) EV diffusion is most significantly impacted by licence plate restrictions, following by charging pile construction subsidy, most sensitive to purchase subsidy policies, and least affected by government R&D subsidies. (2) Moreover, all four policies decrease EV energy benefits but positively impact the carbon emission reduction, health, and social benefits of EVs. The health benefits of EVs are the greatest, followed by the carbon emission reduction benefits. (3) The benefits of government subsidies to EV manufacturers, consumers, and charging infrastructure operators are positive. Finally, by integrating the development situation of China's EV industry, feasible policy suggestions are proposed for sustainable development. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Benefits evaluation; Diffusion; Electric vehicle; Multiagent system dynamics model; Policy intervention","China; Air quality; Automobile manufacture; Automotive industry; Carbon; Electric automobiles; Emission control; Energy security; Multi agent systems; Piles; Public policy; System theory; Agent interaction; Benefit evaluation; Carbon emissions reductions; Carbon neutralities; Complex dynamic systems; Health benefits; Multi-agent interaction; Multiagent system dynamic model; Policy intervention; System dynamics modelling; acoustic emission; automobile industry; carbon budget; carbon emission; diffusion; electric vehicle; energy policy; pile; sustainable development; Diffusion","Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Science in University of Anhui Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71573069, 71972064)","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71972064, 71573069) and the Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Science in University of Anhui Province.","J.

Mineral resources are used as materials for various energy technologies, and with the development of clean energy technologies, the demand for mineral resources will increase. China is a large country with various mineral resources, but its structural supply problem is severe. For China to reach the targets of carbon peaking before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060, they have set specific milestones for developing each clean energy industry; thus, the demand for mineral resources in clean energy will increase. We first summarise the mineral resources supply for China’s development of clean energy technologies. We analyse the demand for various mineral resources in specific clean energy technology sectors under the stated policies scenario and sustainable development scenario through scenario setting. Finally, we combine current domestic mineral resource reserves and overseas import channels to analyse China’s mineral resource supply and demand for developing the clean energy industry. Our results show that the surge in clean energy generation and electric vehicle ownership in China between 2020 and 2050 will lead to a significant increase in demand for mineral resources for these technologies and a shortage in the supply of some mineral resources. In particular, the supply of copper, nickel, cobalt, and lithium will be a severe constraint for clean energy development. We also find that secondary recycling of power battery materials in the electric vehicle sector could alleviate China’s resource constraints. The findings of our study provide a better understanding of the kinds of mineral elements that are in short supply on the path of clean energy development in China under carbon peaking and carbon neutrality targets and the future channels that can be used to increase the supply of minerals. © 2022 by the authors.","carbon neutrality; carbon peaking; clean energy development; energy transition; mineral resource demand","Economics; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Mineral resources; Minerals; Sustainable development; Carbon neutralities; Carbon peaking; Clean energy; Clean energy development; Clean energy technology; Energy development; Energy transitions; Mineral resource demand; Resource Constraint; Resource demands; Carbon","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71704110); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (21692105000)","This research was funded by the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (Grant No. 21692105000) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Program No. 71704110).","L.

Many countries are planning to ban internal combustion engines by 2030. One of the key issues needed to be addressed before the full‐scale deployment of EVs is ensuring energy security. Various studies have developed models to simulate and study hourly electricity demand from EV charging. In this study, we present an improved model based on discrete event simulation, which allows for modeling characteristics of individual EV users, including the availability of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) outside homes and the charging threshold of each EV user. The model is illustrated by simulating 1000 random electric vehicles generated using data from an actual survey. The results agree with previ-ous studies that daily charging demands do not significantly vary. However, the results show a significant shift in charging schedule during weekends. Moreover, the simulation demonstrated that the charging peak demand can be reduced by as much as 11% if EVSEs are made more available outside homes. Interestingly, a behavioral solution, such as requiring users to fully utilize their EV’s battery capacity, is more effective in reducing the peak demand (14–17%). Finally, the study con-cludes by discussing a few potential implications on electric vehicle charging policy. © 2021 by the authors.

This study explores the commercial viability of using electric vehicles (EVs), recharged by solar minigrids, to provide transport services in off-grid communities. Preliminary findings are presented from a field trial in The Gambia that aims to assess the techno-economic feasibility of integrating sustainable energy and transport infrastructures in sun-rich regions of the Global South. As a dispatchable anchor load, an EV can improve the technical and economic performance of a minigrid by providing demand-side response services. In the developing world, rural communities are often among the poorest, and inadequate transport services remain a major barrier to wealth-creation. Some solutions to this situation may be transferrable to island communities, which share similar challenges in terms of access to energy and fuel. The first of its kind in Africa, this field trial uses an electric minivan, operating from an off-grid village where it has access to a minigrid whose 4.5 kWp of photovoltaic modules form the roof of a parking shelter for the vehicle. While there, the taxi can recharge, ideally during sunny periods when the photovoltaic array produces surplus power, thus allowing the EV’s battery to recharge while bypassing the minigrid’s own accumulator. This improves system reliability and cost effectiveness, while providing pollution-free energy for the taxi. Ultimately, the intention is to test different vehicles in a variety of circumstances, but this paper outlines only the preliminary findings of the first of these trials. Early results provide convincing new evidence that commercial viability of such a concept is possible in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some promising scenarios for commercial viability are identified, which warrant further investigation, since they suggest that a taxi driver’s earnings could be increased between 250 and 1,300% in local operations, and even 20-fold in tourist markets, depending on vehicle type, minigrid configuration and target market. It is hoped that these may encourage the rollout of solar-recharged EVs where the nexus of sustainable energy and transport systems are likely to make the greatest contribution to addressing the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, by helping to solve the trilemma of providing energy security, social benefit and environmental sustainability in low-income countries. © Copyright © 2021 Gammon and Sallah.","developing world; electric vehicles; international development; low-carbon transport; minigrids; smart recharging; solar energy; sub-Saharan Africa","Automobile testing; Commerce; Commercial vehicles; Cost effectiveness; Demand side management; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Electric automobiles; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy security; Free energy; Photovoltaic cells; Reliability; Sustainable development; Taxicabs; Commercial viability; Demand side response; Economic performance; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental sustainability; Photovoltaic modules; Techno-economic feasibility; Transport infrastructure; Commercial vehicle operations","Nissan Europe; De Montfort University, DMU","Funding text 1: The authors declare that this study received funding from Nissan Europe.

Over the last few decades, the world has experienced increased emissions of toxic gases, severe global warming, and ambient air pollution. Mass dependency on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles is rightfully criticized for increasing air pollution, jeopardizing societal health outcomes, and perpetuating the use of fossil fuels-all of which threaten sustainable development. Amid this situation, to ensure economic and social growth as well as help to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) by improving energy security, electric vehicles (EVs) are the green alternatives to conventional high-emission vehicles. To successfully promote EV adoption and diffusion in emerging economies, the key drivers that may foster the adoption process must be identified and evaluated. However, there exists a conspicuous literature gap in this domain. This study presents an intelligent multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, integrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), and Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) to identify, examine, and classify the drivers of successful adoption of EVs in the emerging economies. Based on the literature review and expert feedback, a total of seventeen drivers were identified and later prioritized by using PCA. The top twelve drivers have been further analyzed using ISM-MICMAC to examine their interrelationships. The findings reveal that vehicle performance and reliability, adequate power and charging infrastructure, and government policies are the most influential factors for EV adoption. Finally, this study offers several managerial implications and prospects, which may aid governments and the automotive sectors in taking strategic measures to capture this booming market and pursue more EV customers for a sustainable future. © 2022 The Author(s)","Electric vehicles; Environmental pollution; Interpretive Structural Modeling; Principal Component Analysis; Sustainable transportation","","","","A.B.M.M.

However, the emission reduction impacts of EVs in China have been widely debated and the conclusions of existing studies are still controversial. In this study, we adopted the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to evaluate the carbon dioxide (CO2) and air pollutant emissions from the stage of vehicle production, vehicle use and vehicle end-of-life. We further compared the emissions of three types of passenger vehicles in China, including internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), and battery electric vehicle (BEV). Compared with ICEV, BEV and PHEV were found to reduce the emissions of CO2, VOCs, and NOX, but increase the emissions of PM2.5 and SO2. These differences were primarily caused by EV's high fuel efficiency and high fuel consumption of ICEV. Additional findings indicate that the emissions of PM2.5 and SO2 of BEV were 2.6 and 2.1 times that of ICEV, respectively; and the emissions of PM2.5 and SO2 of PHEV were 1.8 and 1.5 times that of ICEV, respectively. Moreover, we found the emissions of PM2.5 and SO2 of EV will be higher than that of ICEV in high renewable energy scenario with higher biomass share if keeping the emission factor of electricity constant. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; Carbon dioxide emissions; China; Electric vehicle; Life cycle assessment","Air quality; Battery electric vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Combustion; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy security; Internal combustion engines; Life cycle; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutant emission; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental assessment; Global climate changes; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Vehicle end-of-life; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","China's National Key R&D Program; China’s National Key R&D Program, (2016YFA0602603); Graduate Technological Innovation Project of Beijing Institute of Technology; Huo Yingdong education fund , Training and Practice Base for Innovative Energy Talents; Huo Yingdong education fund, Training and Practice Base for Innovative Energy Talents; National Bureau of Statistics of China, NBS, (2018CX20005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71521002, 71603020, 71642004, 71822401, 71904180); Beijing Municipal Commission of Education; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (JQ19035)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge financial support received through China's National Key R&D Program (2016YFA0602603) and from Beijing Natural Science Foundation (JQ19035), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71822401, 71603020, 71521002, 71904180 and 71642004), Huo Yingdong education fund, Training and Practice Base for Innovative Energy Talents, the Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education, and the Graduate Technological Innovation Project of Beijing Institute of Technology (NBS, 2018CX20005).

Simultaneously oil, gas, coal, aviation, steel and cement industries and livestock farming have to be largely shut down to eliminate GHG. This review argues that globally all this will not happen by 2050, let alone 2030 because the scale of the problem is too large. Transport is particularly difficult to decarbonize and current policies focusing entirely on battery electric vehicles will not and must not succeed. GHG levels are unlikely to come down significantly in the next several decades and even if they did, extreme weather events will not disappear. It is better to recognize such realities and make societies more resilient to the effects of climate change. Humanity will have to adapt to any further warming as it has successfully done with the previous warming of about 1.1 C over the past century. Combustion research, particularly of fossil fuels and in internal combustion engines is currently seen as unnecessary in many countries. However, it will be absolutely necessary, along with the development of the alternatives in order to ensure that energy use is improved since combustion will continue to be central to supplying global energy and driving transport for decades to come. The gap between current policies and reality will perhaps be bridged as energy security concerns come to the fore. © 2022","Battery electric vehicles; Energy transition; Existential crisis; Net zero greenhouse gas","Cement industry; Climate change; Coal combustion; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Internal combustion engines; Secondary batteries; Vehicles; 'current; Battery-electric vehicles; Combustion research; Energy transitions; Existential crisis; Fuel use; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Net zero greenhouse gas; Oil gas; Greenhouse gases","","","","","Elsevier Ltd","2666691X","","","","English","Transp.

This transition is creating new geopolitical dynamics. In the past, traditional energy geopolitics focused on the concentrated distribution of fossil fuel resources and the conflicts and dependencies that this created. In contrast, the ‘new’ renewable energy geopolitics emphasises the dispersed distribution or decentralisation of production capacity and the independence of states this generates. However, the market for lithium, which is essential to renewable energy storage through being a key component of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, does not entirely fit theoretical conceptions of the renewable energy market’s dynamics. By focusing on China as a critical case, this article shows that lithium geopolitics has potentially created new (inter)dependencies and opportunities for conflicts, while also paradoxically enhancing state interindependence in renewable technology energy production. Thus, this hybrid form of energy geopolitics necessitates revising conventional energy security explanations to match these new market conditions. © 2022, Fudan University.","China; Electric vehicles; Lithium geopolitics; Lithium market; Lithium-ion batteries","","","","S.O.

Accordingly, a myriad of dynamic mitigation devices have been proposed in the last few decades where these devices are installed at strategic points in the grid. Transformer-less power electronics-based modules, integrated between the neutral and substation ground of traditional transformers, have been proposed introducing a variety of advanced grid mitigation and support features; DC elimination, voltage regulation, voltage and impedance balancing, harmonics isolation and power flow control. However, the protection of these series-connected modules against high voltage development during ground faults or inrush currents is critical as it could damage these converter-based mitigation devices or exceed the transformer BIL rating, thus, severely threatening the energy security. This paper presents an effective transformer and the module protection scheme utilizing a hybrid AC/DC solid-state switch. The proposed scheme is evaluated on an emulated 25-kVA, 7.2kV/240V single-phase hybrid smart transformer (HST), utilizing Typhoon HIL that verifies its promising performance. © 2021 IEEE.","Grid reliability; Hybrid smart transformers; Hybrid switch; Power system protection","DC transformers; Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Electric power system control; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Energy security; HVDC power transmission; Power electronics; Rectifying circuits; Vehicle-to-grid; Voltage regulators; Distributed Energy Resources; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Harmonics isolation; Mitigation devices; Mitigation measures; Power flow controls; Rapid transformations; Solid state switch; Transformer protection","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Environmental Management, EM; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD; Savannah River National Laboratory, SRNL, (DE-AC09-08SR22470)","This work was supported by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program within the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL).

Understanding consumer preferences for PEV attributes and policies is critical to accelerate mass PEV penetration. This study examines consumer preference heterogeneity in adopting PEVs with mixed logit (MXL), latent class (LC), and latent class-mixed logit (LC-MXL) models based on a stated preference survey in Virginia, U.S. Consistently, all three models indicate that providing a monetary incentive is most effective in increasing the overall PEV market share, followed by deploying more charging infrastructure, while improvement in battery range shows a weak impact. Furthermore, the choice models that capture preference heterogeneity provide more nuanced results on the effectiveness of policies on a specific consumer segment and for a specific vehicle powertrain type. Lastly, when considering various model evaluation measures (e.g., model fit, prediction accuracy, and behavioral interpretation), results show that no model is unanimously superior to the other models. Rather, altogether they uncover a more comprehensive picture of EV preference structure. Findings provide insights into the usefulness of each choice modeling framework for future PEV adoption research. Also, it informs policymakers to be aware of alternative models which can provide different perspectives on policy implications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Latent Class; Mixed Logit; Plug-in Electric Vehicles; Preference Heterogeneity; Stated Preference","United States; Virginia; Climate change; Energy security; Plug-in electric vehicles; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Public policy; Choice model; Consumers' preferences; Latent class; Mixed logit; Mixed logit models; Model-based OPC; Policy implications; Preference heterogeneity; Stated preferences; Vehicle penetration; electric vehicle; heterogeneity; logit analysis; numerical model; policy approach; transportation policy; Competition","Mid-Atlantic Transportation Sustainability University Transportation Center, MATS UTC, (146221)","This study is funded by Mid-Atlantic Transportation Sustainability University Transportation Center (MATS UTC) Grant No: 146221.","T.D.

Technological innovation is an inexhaustible driving force for the development of the new energy vehicle industry. This study considered listed enterprises in China’s new energy vehicle industry as research samples and used the fixed effect model to study the impact of government subsidies on the quantity and quality of technological innovation in the new energy vehicle industry. The empirical results show that government subsidies have a significant positive impact on the quantity of technological innovation in the new energy vehicle industry; however, government subsidies have no significant impact on the quality of technological innovation. Government subsidies increase the quantity of technological innovation in the new energy vehicle industry by increasing R&D investment, mitigating financing constraints, and improving the external attention of enterprises. Compared to downstream enterprises in the industrial chain, government subsidies have a better incentive effect on the technological innovation of upstream enterprises, which increases the number of patents and enhances the quality of utility model patents.

This may inevitably have an impact on the country’s economic structure. Future policies should be carefully formulated, taking into consideration both the positives and negatives, as well as the short-and long-term effects on the nation’s energy and economy in the future. This will ensure that the nation receives the maximum benefit in terms of energy security, carbon targets, environmental and social care, and sustainable economic growth. The various driving factors to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 were analyzed based on the STEEP analysis, with an emphasis on the energy sector, which is found to make the largest contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. It found that political will, green technology, and financial incentives are the most influential factors in achieving the carbon neutrality target. These factors are considered as critical uncertainties when building two future scenarios for the energy sector. The Classic scenario reflects the attempt to achieve carbon neutrality with an emphasis on clean technologies, such as renewable energy, green hydrogen, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). Meanwhile, the target will become even more challenging when energy efficiency is to be increased, such as electric vehicle. The Orchestra scenario shows how energy management, a decentralized energy system and promoting the prosumer market, especially in the residential sector, are used to try to reach carbon neutrality. In conclusion, both scenarios may result in the achievement of the 2050 carbon neutrality target. The Orchestra scenario may need planning, a holistic management approach, and active cooperation from various sectors. On the contrary, in the Classic scenario, most activities are restricted to the energy sector, which may entail some risks, particularly the rising demand for carbon offsets from other countries. © 2023, Econjournals.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become the primary power source for EVs, given their high energy/power density and long service lifetime. However, safety is still a big challenge facing the population of LIBs. Internal short circuit (ISC) is one of the root causes for the failure of LIBs, whereas the mechanism of ISC formation and evolution is still unclear. This paper provides a comprehensive review of formation mechanisms, evolution framework, experimental approaches, detection methods and mitigation strategies of ISC in LIBs. Learning from the typical safety accidents of LIBs, ISC primarily which caused by typical factors is intensively investigated. Later, the behavior and evolution framework of ISC are profoundly elaborated. The ISC experimental approaches are systematically classified into conventional experimental approaches and novel experimental approaches, and their advantages and drawbacks are summarized in detail, respectively. Further, ISC detection methods including offline and online detection methods are comprehensively analyzed. Finally, an insight into the research perspective of ISC mitigation is provided. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Detection methods; Evolution framework; Experimental approaches; Formation mechanism; Internal short circuit; ISC mitigation; Lithium-ion batteries","Automotive industry; Energy security; Ions; Timing circuits; Detection methods; Environmental concerns; Evolution framework; Experimental approaches; Formation mechanism; Internal short circuit; Internal short circuit mitigation; Internal shorts; Primary power sources; Lithium-ion batteries","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (U20A20310)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Grant No. U20A20310 ).","X.

For this purpose, this paper develops three scenarios representing different levels of EV penetration and assesses the scenario impacts with a view to identify policy implications and policy trade-offs of an increased EV deployment. A Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) model is employed, in this study, to assess the scenario impacts for the period 2020–2037. The analyses showed that high EV deployment in the transport sector would provide noticeable benefits, for example, reducing energy demand in the transport sector, decreasing primary energy requirements, and mitigating emissions of CO2, NOx and PM2.5. An increase in electricity generation would be, however, required for supporting increased EVs. The analyses further revealed that the impacts of high EV adoption in the transport sector could be considered in terms of both emerging challenges and opportunities. In terms of emerging challenges, promotion of EV adoption would pose several challenges including electricity grid impacts, energy security issues, and impacts on related industries. In order to address these challenges, the development of long-term electricity planning taking into account various issues, for example, a mixture of generating capacity additions, infrastructure expansion, coordinated charging, and time-of-use tariff setting would be essentially needed. EVs deployment would also bring several opportunities including the implementation of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology in smart grid and integration of renewable energy with V2X in smart grid. The success of these opportunities would, however, require policy supports from the Thai government and also the development of a consistent policy framework considering all related sectors. This framework is urgently required in order to provide effective strategies for developing sustainable future of electric mobility in Thailand. © 2022 The Authors","Electric vehicle; Electricity sector; Renewable energy; Thailand; Transport sector","Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Energy security; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Vehicle-to-grid; Electricity sector; Low emission; Policy implications; Renewable energies; Road transport sectors; Smart grid; Thailand; Trade off; Transport sectors; Vehicle penetration; Economic and social effects","Mahasarakham University, MSU","This research project was financially supported by Mahasarakham University 2021.

Increasing density of IC engine powered vehicles, urban air pollution, traffic congestion and wastage of valuable land for parking have negative impact economically, ecologically and politically. Moreover, an increasing preference for personal mobility, owing to the pandemic and social distancing norms has witnessed notable growth in automobile sales. Hence, a strategy to replace conventional vehicles is urgently required by electric vehicles, which is one of the most promising alternative technologies. Governments also recognized the value of electric mobility in building a cleaner, smarter and more sustainable future cities. Adoption of low-cost, light weight and low power electric vehicles designed for the city environment can considerably reduce the impact of personal mobility not only by reducing energy consumption but also by minimizing the use of parking and driving space in comparison with conventional vehicles. This paper proposes and develops an environmentally friendly low-cost electric microcar that maneuvers easily in city heavy traffic with zero emissions and benefits the high energy efficiency, energy security and noise pollution reduction. An analytical modeling is carried out for sizing of powertrain elements. CAD modeling of chassis frame using solid works followed by analysis using ANSYS is also performed. A double seater low-cost electric microcar with comprehensible mechanism has demonstrated a range of 75 km on full charging. A simple fuel and emission analysis has observed that around 851.66 liters of petroleum fuel saving and corresponding 2.077 tonnes of carbon dioxide reduction annually with this prototype.  © 2022 SAE International.

As a result, a reduced dependency on conventional hydrocarbon resources may lead to new and unexpected interdependencies, including dependencies on raw materials. It is concluded that to minimize the impact of a metal-intensive transition to clean transportation, in addition to overcoming challenges with minerals mining and processing, further progress in understanding the properties of critical materials will be required to better correlate them with intended applications, to identify potential substitutions and to optimize their use through the sustainable exploration of their resources and a circular economy. © 2022 by the author.","circular economy; clean energy; critical minerals; electric vehicles; recycling; zero-emission vehicles","Energy security; Environmental technology; Materials handling; Mineral resources; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum transportation; Supply chains; Vehicles; 'current; Automotive supply chains; Circular economy; Clean energy; Clean energy technology; Conventional hydrocarbons; Critical minerals; Environmental concerns; Zero emission; Zero emission vehicles; Minerals","Government of Canada; Office of Energy Research and Development, OERD","This research was funded by the Office of Energy Research and Development (OERD) of the Government of Canada.","F.

The 6th ASEAN Energy Outlook (AEO6) projected the sector's oil consumption to rapidly grow to 330 million ton of oil equivalent (Mtoe) by 2040 or about 97% from total energy consumed in the sector. Mostly imported, the ever-increasing oil demand poses risk to economic and energy security. The growing concern of climate change also brings another issue to the sector. Cleaner mobility alternatives include electric vehicle. This study aims to assess the readiness of electric mobility roll-out in Southeast Asia, especially from supporting policy perspective.

Furthermore, the conventional transportation system also emits other particulate matter into the atmosphere that causes air pollution and associated health issues. Thus, the aforementioned negative consequences of fossil-based transport system make it central to the energy and climate challenge. Therefore, the most practical and sustainable solution for effective mitigation of climate change and energy security concerns is the electrification of the transportation sector – a paradigm shift in the conventional mobility sector. As the electric power system is already in transition and experiencing its own paradigm shift – Smart(er) Grid – “Transportation Electrification” is thus the timely development for introducing a paradigm shift in the mobility sector. The vision of electrified mobility is to lower the environmental footprint of the transportation sector, which further demands the utilization of more renewable energy resource-based generation mix in the electricity grid – “Greener Grid.” Thus, in this chapter, we explain the potential of transportation electrification for reducing the harmful climatic emissions and the nexus of energy and economy with electric mobility. The contrasting narrative of direct and indirect electrification with structural changes is further discussed with implications on cross-sectoral balance. We then provide an overview of the V2X horizon which includes vehicle-to-grid, vehicle-to-home, and building technology concepts. Moreover, we also investigate the concept of “smart vehicles” with the incorporation of “Artificial Intelligence” and some key enabling yet transdisciplinary technologies. Lastly, we present innovative alternative solutions for fueling the vehicles and the main trends, challenges, and future research directions in electric mobility transformation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

The electrification of transport will increase energy security, reduce carbon emissions, and improve local air quality. The actual expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) will depend on several factors: the evolution of autonomy, the acquisition price, the charging process and infrastructure, etc. This paper provides a guide for simulating the accumulative load profile for EV charging on a national level. The importance of all the parameters and variables involved (deterministic or stochastic) is investigated. Detailed tables and references concerning the distribution of values and the composition of the EV fleet are provided. A multivariate probabilistic model is developed considering the EV classes, weekly and seasonal driving patterns, charging strategies, battery capacities, consumption per EV, etc., leading to an accurate estimation of aggregated EV charging demand.

Environmental and energy challenges can be addressed using Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). Automobile manufacturers have understood that EVs are important to the industry's future. Access to charging, EV range, perceived cost, and lack of public understanding about the availability and usability of these vehicles are all obstacles to increased adoption. Although EVs have a greater upfront cost, their operational costs are cheaper. When compared to traditional Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs), policies that lower the total cost of ownership of EVs and PHEVs will contribute to faster market penetration. There is a major need for fast charging stations and infrastructure to support such a high number of EVs on the road. This paper examines numerous elements, including their rate of acceleration, different rapid charging strategies, and different power converter topologies for EVs, as stated above and explored in more detail in subsequent parts. When charging a vehicle's battery, the battery's safety and charging time must be taken into account.  © 2022 IEEE.","DC-DC converter; Electric Vehicle (EV); Fast charging; Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)","Charging (batteries); Electric inverters; Energy security; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Secondary batteries; Topology; Automobile manufacturers; Converter topologies; Electric vehicle; Electric vehicle charging; Energy; Fast charging; Perceived costs; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Public understanding; DC-DC converters","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166545915-0","","","English","Int.

This study investigates impacts of a hypothetical, complete transition from conventionally-fueled to hydrogen-powered German transport through representative scenarios. Our results show that German emissions change between −179 and +95 MtCO2eq annually, depending on the scenario, with renewable-powered electrolysis leading to the greatest emissions reduction, while electrolysis using the fossil-intense current electricity mix leads to the greatest increase. German energy emissions of regulated pollutants decrease significantly, indicating the potential for simultaneous air quality improvements. Vehicular hydrogen demand is 1000 PJ annually, requiring 446–525 TWh for electrolysis, hydrogen transport and storage, which could be supplied by future German renewable generation, supporting the potential for CO2-free hydrogen traffic and increased energy security. Thus hydrogen-powered transport could contribute significantly to climate and air quality goals, warranting further research and political discussion about this possibility. © 2020 The Authors","Air pollution; Emission scenarios; Fuel cell electric vehicle; German road transport; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Hydrogen economy","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Electrolysis; Emission control; Energy security; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Air pollutant emission; Air quality improvement; Emissions reduction; Energy emissions; Hydrogen Energy; Hydrogen transport; Regulated pollutants; Renewable generation; Hydrogen economy","Brandenburg State Ministry for Science, Research and Culture; German Federal Ministry for Education and Research; Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; Brandenburger Staatsministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kultur, MWFK","This work was supported by the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) , Potsdam, Germany, which is in turn funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) and the Brandenburg State Ministry for Science, Research and Culture (MWFK) .

As a result, EVs are rapidly increasing in popularity, electrifying the transportation sector. This poses a serious problem for the grid as existing distribution grids were mainly sized in the pre-EV era. In this paper, a method is proposed to determine the charging demand of future EV fleets in an office area and determine its flexibility potential. Office charging is studied as it differs from residential charging and a limited number of studies focused solely on office charging. The study is an empirical study and is based on analysing real transaction data of 42 EVs charging for over a year at Utrecht Science Park, Utrecht, the Netherlands, the considered case study. The transaction data allows for an examination of the impacts of future EV charging demand in an office area. The results based on a future scenario study show that in 2050, 4 out of 7 studied transformers are overloaded. This is followed by an analysis on the mitigation of the determined impact. This analysis also determined the flexibility in EV demand, around 50% of the EV demand can be delayed for more than 8 h. When this flexibility is used, overloading of 3 out of 4 transformers could be mitigated. This paper shows that placement of charging stations should be strategically performed, considering the capacity of the network and taking into account the forecasted load due to EVs charging. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Charging power; Demand flexibility; Electric vehicles; Grid impact","Electric transformers; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Distribution grid; Distribution transformer; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Empirical studies; Local air pollutions; Real transaction data; Residential charging; Transportation sector; Charging (batteries)","European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","We would like to thank W.L.

Besides, fossil fuel vehicles are gradually replaced with electric ones. Increasing the penetration of RES on the supply side and the penetration of Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) on the demand side, intermittency of the power system increases. This paper proposes a novel structure for Virtual storage plants (VSP) to integrate the storage potentials of the PEVs into power systems. The suggested VSP is comprised of smart charging stations, Parking lot aggregator (PLA), Local service provider (LSP), and Global service provider (GSP). The PLA coordinates the charging/discharging strategies of the PEVs based on the flexibility requirements of the supply side. The LSP aims to mitigate congestion in weak lines of the power network. The GSP provides up-/down-regulation for the wholesale electricity market when a power shortage/excess occurs in the power systems. On the supply side, the electricity market is comprised of three trading floors, including the day-ahead, intraday, and balancing markets. The VSP integrates the storage potentials of the PEVs to the three market floors hierarchically on long, mid, and short advance notices. The electricity price data are extracted from the Danish electricity market. The suggested approach is examined on the IEEE 14-bus system. The results show that the suggested VSP provides local and global energy security for the power system during critical hours. © 2021 The Author(s)","Electric vehicle; Local/global service provider; Parking lot aggregator; Stochastic; Virtual storage plant","Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric industry; Energy security; Floors; Fossil fuels; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Global services providers; Local/global service provider; Parking lot aggregator; Parking lots; Power; Renewable energy source; Stochastics; Storage plants; Supply sides; Virtual storage plant; Stochastic systems","Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University; European Commission, EC","Funding: The study is supported by the FEVER project (Flexible Energy Production, Demand and Storage-based Virtual Power Plants for Electricity Markets and Resilient DSO Operation), Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University, Denmark (European Union's Horizon 2020).

With the development of the electric system, electric vehicles and railway systems are utilizing and generalizing. To accurately and adequately evaluate the energy consumption and CO2 emission effects of fuel and electric vehicles, this study focuses on these two kinds of vehicles, including buses and cars, and analyses their environmental impacts. Results show that electric vehicles consume less heat energy and release less CO2 emission than fuel vehicles do at the same distance. Public vehicles consume much less heat energy than private cars no matter which kind of fuel they use. In addition, the CO2 emission of fuel cars is larger than that of fuel buses. Moreover, electric energy is cheaper than gasoline and diesel. Therefore, the electric power will benefit the environment and society. The power should be recommended to substitute oil in the future. Although electric vehicles still have some limitations, such as prolonging the life of batteries, developing new energy, and green energy can guarantee energy security and benefit the environment and reduce the emission of CO2. © 2021 EDP Sciences.

Electric vehicles (EVs) adoption at a worldwide scale is seen as a possible solution to mitigate global warming and security of energy supply. Charging stations (CS) are an obligatory requirement to meet the energy demand of EVs. Because of the incorrect location and size of the CS, other technical issues arise, such as fluctuations in voltage levels and abrupt increase in system's loss. The efficient allocation of CS and capacitors (CAP) is presented in this research work to sustain voltage profile and reduce losses in electrical grid networks. In this work, the aim of minimizing power loss is considered along with some constraints such as power balance equations, voltage limits, and thermal limits. The metaheuristic-based optimization algorithm i.e., GWO is employed to handle the objective functions. This proposed technique is tested on East Delta Network (EDN) consisting of 30 buses. The results show how optimal CS and CAP planning affects system's loss and voltage levels in standard electrical networks.

In addition, energy efficiency measures can reduce consumption, making it easier to shift to a zero-carbon society. In Québec, upgrades to aging buildings that employ electric resistance heating offer a unique opportunity to free up large amounts of hydroelectricity that can serve to decarbonize heating in other buildings. However, another source of energy would be needed to electrify mobility because efficiency measures free up small amounts of electricity in summer compared to winter. This study reveals how building efficiency measures combined with solar electricity generation provide an energy profile that matches the requirements for decarbonizing both mobility and heating. The TRNSYS software was used to simulate the annual energy performance of an existing house and retrofitted/rebuilt low-energy houses equipped with a photovoltaic (PV) roof in Montreal, Québec, Canada (45.5◦ N). The electricity that is made available by upgrading the houses is mainly considered for powering battery and fuel cell electric vehicles (BEVs and FCEVs) and electrifying heating in greenhouses. The results indicate that retrofitting 16% or rebuilding 12% of single-detached homes in Québec can provide enough electricity to decarbonize heating energy use in existing greenhouses and to operate the new greenhouses required for growing all fresh vegetables locally. If all the single-detached houses that employ electric resistance heating are upgraded, 33.4 and 21.8 TWh year−1 of electricity would be available for decarbonization, equivalent to a 19% and 12% increase of the province’s electricity supply for the retrofitted or rebuilt houses, respectively. This is enough energy to convert 83–100% of personal vehicles to BEVs or 35–56% to FCEVs. Decarbonization using the electricity that is made available by upgrading to low-energy solar houses could reduce the province’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by approximately 32% (26.5 MtCO2eq). The time required for the initial embodied GHG emissions to surpass the emissions avoided by electrification ranges from 3.4 to 11.2 years. Building energy efficiency retrofits/rebuilds combined with photovoltaics is a promising approach for Québec to maximize the decarbonization potential of its existing energy resources while providing local energy and food security. © 2021 by the authors.

Smart charging solutions should spread this load, but there is a residual risk of incidental peaks. A decentralized and autonomous technology called GridShield is being developed to reduce the likelihood of a transformer’s fuse blowing when other congestion solutions have failed. It serves as a measure of last resort to protect the grid against local power failures from unpredicted congestion by temporarily limiting the virtual capacity of charging stations. This paper describes the technical development and demonstrates how GridShield can keep a transformer load below a critical limit using simulations and real-world tests. It optimizes grid capacity while ensuring grid reliability. © 2023 by the authors.","charging infrastructure; electric vehicles; energy network; energy security; load management; smart charging","Charging (batteries); Electric loads; Energy security; Outages; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging infrastructures; Charging solutions; Decentralised; Energy networks; Load management; Low-voltage grid; Power; Power outage; Residual risk; Smart charging; Electric vehicles","Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland, RVO","This research was carried out in the Project SmoothEMS met GridShield (MOOI32005), with the support of RVO—Netherlands Enterprise Agency.","M.

Therefore, for the first time in this work, solar-battery storage integrated switchable glazing topology has been applied for providing day-time passive heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) in EV charging station control rooms. The EV charging station has been accompanied by a solar PV source installed on its roof-top to promote green energy and sustainable transportation. Vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) has been integrated with the system to ensure energy security as a long-life energy storage solution. To satisfy the building glazing load demand under real-time dynamic environmental conditions, an Internet of Things (IoT) based smart scheduling of solar PV, VRFB storage and the local distribution grid has been demonstrated. The performance of the proposed system has been validated under four different transient scenarios; sunny, intermittent cloudy, prolonged cloudy and low solar irradiance with frequent grid outages.

Nowadays, compared to gasoline vehicles, whether the EVs are more competitive in terms of cost is still a question. There is no consensus achieved since the total cost depends on the development stage of the automobile industry and power generation structure as well as the cost accounting boundary. Many of existing studies did not include the costs occurred in all the stages. In response to this concern, this study estimates the lifecycle cost covering the whole process of production, use, disposal, and infrastructure construction as well as externalities for passenger battery electric vehicle (BEV), fuel cell vehicle (FCV), and gasoline vehicle (GV) by applying the comprehensive lifecycle cost model to China. The results indicate that in 2018, BEV and FCV were more expensive than GV (1.2–5.3 times), but that BEV will become cheaper after 2025, and its cost advantage will be enlarged to $419 (5%) compared to GV by 2030. The lifecycle cost of FCV will be $527 (or 5%) lower than that of GV by 2030. These results clarify that the costs of vehicle production account for the largest proportion in the total lifecycle cost. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Battery electric vehicle (BEV); China; Cost competitive; Fuel cell vehicle (FCV); Lifecycle cost model","Air Pollution; China; Electricity; Gasoline; Motor Vehicles; Vehicle Emissions; China; gasoline; atmospheric pollution; automobile industry; cost analysis; electric vehicle; fuel cell; life cycle analysis; power generation; air pollution; China; electricity; exhaust gas; motor vehicle","China’s National Key R&D Program, (2016YFA0602603); Graduate Technological Innovation Project of Beijing Institute of Technology, (2018CX20005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (71521002, 71603020, 71642004, 71822401, 71904180); Beijing Municipal Commission of Education; Huo Yingdong Education Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (JQ19035)","This study received financial supports from the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (JQ19035), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71822401, 71603020, 71521002, 71904180, and 71642004), China’s National Key R&D Program (2016YFA0602603), Huo Yingdong Education Fund, the Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education, and the Graduate Technological Innovation Project of Beijing Institute of Technology (No. 2018CX20005).

With the growing energy shortage and the worsening of environmental pollution, electric vehicle (EV), as a new energy vehicle driven by electric energy, has attracted more and more attention. Because of its small size, high efficiency, large overload capacity and fast response, the brushless electric motor has occupied an important position in the servo field and is an ideal choice for electric drive systems of electric vehicles. The control precision of PMSM depends on the precision of rotor position detection to a great extent. The traditional method of obtaining rotor position is realized by high resolution position sensors, such as resolver, photoelectric encoder. It can obtain the rotor flux position with high resolution accurately and in real time, but this method has high cost. In order to reduce the cost of rotor position detection, the sensorless control technology has been developed. The rotor position is estimated by detecting the variables such as current, voltage and motor parameters. However, the Control Algorithm is complex and requires high parameters, and it doesn't work at full speed. Computationally efficient design of interior permanent magnet (IPM) motor rotor features is investigated utilizing analytical methods. The rotating transformer and the high-frequency signal method independently detect the rotor position, the high-frequency signal method verifies the detection precision of the rotating transformer at low speed, and the high-frequency signal method rotor position detection system at high speed stops working, in the case of a rotating transformer fault, the high frequency signal method system supports the motor to drive at low speed in fault mode.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

At present batteries are dominating the storage technology of electric vehicles, however due to the challenging power demands of the urban driving cycles, batteries face accelerated deterioration. To compensate for the loss, manufacturers tend to oversize the batteries at the expense of additional cost and weight. Researchers have observed that battery life can be increased significantly by smoothening the battery charging and discharging currents [2]. Hence Electric vehicle manufacturers worldwide have incorporated several variations of Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) with combinations of conventional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), Fuel cells, Batteries, Ultra Capacitors (UC), etc. intending to decouple the high power and high energy demands and assign them to separate sources. In this study, an electrical forklift that runs with the lead-Acid battery as its Energy Storage System (ESS) was considered. Hybrid Ultra Capacitor (HUC) banks were integrated with a lead-Acid battery pack similar to that of the forklift and the performance of the HESS was studied for the forklift application.

A Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading has emerged as one of the most promising alternatives for relieving the load imposed on the traditional grid enabling two individuals to buy and sell energy directly without intermediaries. However, the Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV) environment is trustless, and such P2P energy trading is prone to different kinds of cyber attacks. Blockchain technology has lately been proposed to implement V2V energy trading to securely and fairly share energy. The consensus mechanism is one of the most important modules of blockchain applied to the V2V network. It determines the efficiency and security among untrustworthy EVs of the energy trading blockchain (ETB). Nevertheless, most works on ETB have currently adopted traditional consensus mechanisms. Due to high computing power and communication overhead, these consensus algorithms are unsuitable for applications requiring real-time services such as energy trading. The efficient and secured Hashgraph is the revolutionary technology of consensus in blockchain and a promising technology suitable for V2V energy trading with frequent transactions. However, Hashgraph does not support the dynamic addition and deletion of nodes and is completely decentralized and vulnerable to Sybil Attack in a large-scale blockchain. Furthermore, this &#x201C;complete decentralization&#x201D; model may result in states losing the ability to macro-control the energy industry and even systemic energy security issues. Therefore, we propose a Block Alliance Consensus (BAC) mechanism to solve these problems. BAC can maintain the throughput of Hashgraph and resist Sybil Attack in a large-scale P2P energy trading network. We design a cryptography-based leader election mechanism and adopt a reputation incentive mechanism to motivate honest and cooperative electric vehicles (EVs). Finally, we implement ETB and the BAC consensus mechanism on the Hyperledger Fabric platform. The high efficiency and security of BAC and the blockchain-based V2V energy trading platform are verified through experiments.

The development of eco-friendly vehicle technologies, such as electric and hydrogen vehicles, has increased. This article investigates whether hydrogen vehicles will replace electric vehicles in the future. The results showed that fuel-cell cars are unlikely to compete with electric cars. This is due to the advancements in electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, which are becoming more cost-effective and efficient. Additionally, the technical progress in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is expected to reduce the market share of fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) in passenger vehicles. However, significant investments have been made in hydrogen cars. Many ongoing investments seem to follow the sunk cost fallacy, where decision-makers continue to invest in an unprofitable project due to their already invested resources. Furthermore, even with megawatt charging, fuel-cell trucks cost more than battery-powered electric trucks. The use cases for fuel-cell electric trucks are also much more limited, as their running expenses are higher compared to electric cars. Hydrogen vehicles may be beneficial for heavy transport in remote areas. However, it remains to be seen if niche markets are large enough to support fuel-cell electric truck commercialization and economies of scale. In summary, we believe that hydrogen vehicles will not replace electric cars and trucks, at least before 2050. © 2023 by the authors.","electric cars and trucks; future transportation; hydrogen cars and trucks","Automobiles; Automotive industry; Charging (batteries); Climate change; Commerce; Competition; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Hydrogen; Investments; Secondary batteries; Trucks; Change costs; Electric cars; Electric truck; Energy cost; Future transportation; Growing demand; Hydrogen car; Hydrogen car and truck; Hydrogen vehicles; Toxic emissions; Fuel cells","UAL-FEDER 2020, (UAL2020-TIC-A2080); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU, (PGC2018-098813-B-C33)","This research received support from the the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities under the programme “Proyectos de I+D de Generacion de Conocimiento” of the national programme for the generation of scientific and technological knowledge and strengthening of the R+D+I system through grant number PGC2018-098813-B-C33 and by UAL-FEDER 2020, Ref.

This paper was aimed at studying the energy organization strategy of power-split hybrid electric vehicles based on a reinforcement learning algorithm. A power-split hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) combines the advantages of both series and parallel hybrid vehicle architectures by using a planetary gear set to split and combine the power generated by electric machines and a combustion engine. This improves the fuel economy to some extent. However, to increase the fuel economy to a greater extent. This study primarily introduces the hybrid electric vehicle's structure and presents a reinforcement learning-based management of energy approach for hybrid electric vehicles. It constructs the vehicle power model of HEV and Markov probability transfer model, then designs the energy control strategy based on reinforcement learning, and finally compares it with the energy control strategy based on PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative). Using MATLAB/Simulink, the cycle conditions of NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) and FTP-75 (Federal Test Procedure) are selected to carry out simulation experiments. The energy management technique suggested in this study, which is based on reinforcement learning, may efficiently enhance the usage rate of automotive gasoline. The replication results show that the fuel consumption per 100 km (kilometers) based on reinforcement learning management strategy is 4.6% and 2.7% lower than the PID management strategy under two working conditions. The economy of fuel of the hybrid electric vehicle is also effectively improved.  © 2022 Juanying Zhou et al.","","Automotive industry; Energy security; Fuels; Hybrid vehicles; Learning algorithms; MATLAB; Proportional control systems; Reinforcement learning; Two term control systems; Condition; Control strategies; Development of science and technologies; Ecological security; Energy; Management strategies; Power split hybrid electric vehicles; Proportional integral derivatives; Reinforcement learning algorithms; Reinforcement learnings; Fuel economy","","","J.

To cope with the challenges raised by energy security, sustainability, and pollution, great efforts have been made to encourage the transition from fossil fuel vehicles to electric vehicles and car sharing. In terms of households, home renewable energy equipment such as heat pumps and solar panels are promising solutions. To accelerate the diffusion of these promising and environmentally friendly technologies, an abundance of studies has investigated the factors that impact the adoption of them. Most of the existing literature considered the choice behavior of vehicle types and choice behavior of energy equipment to be exogenous to other. Charging electric vehicles at home will lead to an increase in home energy costs. It is important to understand to what extent a household’s decision to purchase new mobility tools or energy equipment is affected by the other. This paper, therefore, attempts to investigate the correlation between the choice of home energy equipment and the choice of new mobility tools. An inverted sequence stated preference experiment was designed and conducted in the Netherlands to examine the interdependence of mobility tools choice and home energy equipment choice. Two logit models were presented to investigate how the choice of mobility tools and energy equipment impact each other. Results indicate that the promoting effect between electric vehicles and solar panels is bidirectional, while the promoting effect between electric vehicles and heat pumps is unidirectional. © 2023 by the authors.","electric vehicle; home energy equipment; interdependency choice behavior; mobility tools","Electric vehicles; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Solar concentrators; Solar panels; Choice behaviors; Energy equipments; Energy-consumption; Equipment choice; Heat pumps; Home energy equipment; Interdependency choice behavior; Mobility tool; Promoting effect; Solar panels; Energy utilization","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (3132022181)","This research was funded by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, grant number 3132022181.","X.

The proposed model deals with energy trading problems such as insecure energy trading and inefficient charging mechanisms for electric vehicles (EVs) in a vehicular energy network (VEN). EVs face two major problems: finding an optimal charging station and calculating the exact amount of energy required to reach the selected charging station. Moreover, in traditional trading approaches, centralized parties are involved in energy trading, which leads to various issues such as increased computational cost, increased computational delay, data tempering and a single point of failure. Furthermore, EVs face various energy challenges, such as imbalanced load supply and fluctuations in voltage level. Therefore, a demand-response (DR) pricing strategy enables EV users to flatten load curves and efficiently adjust electricity usage. In this work, communication between EVs and aggregators is efficiently performed through blockchain. Moreover, a branching concept is involved in the proposed system, which divides EV data into two different branches: a Fraud Chain (F-chain) and an Integrity Chain (I-chain). The proposed branching mechanism helps solve the storage problem and reduces computational time. Moreover, an attacker model is designed to check the robustness of the proposed system against double-spending and replay attacks. Security analysis of the proposed smart contract is also given in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed work efficiently reduces the charging cost and time in a VEN. © 2022 by the authors.","branching; charging station; consortium blockchain; demand response; double spending; electric vehicles; energy trading; KNN; machine learning; vehicular energy network","Blockchain; Electricity; Machine Learning; Charging (batteries); Costs; Digital storage; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Machine learning; Network security; Power markets; Block-chain; Branching; Charging station; Consortium blockchain; Demand response; Double spending; Energy networks; Energy trading; KNN; Machine-learning; Vehicular energy network; electricity; machine learning; Blockchain","College of Computer and Information Sciences; EIAS Data Science and Blockchain Lab; Prince Sultan University, PSU","This work was supported by the EIAS Data Science and Blockchain Lab, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Prince Sultan University, Riyadh Saudi Arabia.","S.

The reference currents are calculated offline and stored in lookup tables (LUT) using MATLAB/Simulink. The proposed method is compared to conventional Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) strategies applied on Internal Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (IPMSM) by maintaining the EESM excitation current constant and controlling the d-q axis currents for a likewise behavior.

Due to shortages in hard currency, a rising economy and population growth, and rapid industrialization, energy security to meet the national demand for transport is a quite severe problem. As a result, Ethiopia is strengthening its effort to look for clean alternative energy sources, such as biofuels and electricity. Ethiopia's biofuel program relies on cane molasses-based ethanol and jatropha based biodiesel for blending into conventional petroleum fuels. In order to investigate the sustainability of Ethiopian biofuel production and use in transportation fuels in terms of their energy balance and environmental impacts, well-to-wheel (WTW) analysis was conducted. The WTW energy saving, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction benefits and criteria air pollutants of blending different commonly used ratios of ethanol with gasoline, biodiesel with diesel and electricity mix (mostly (90%) from hydropower) were analysed in the Ethiopian situation. It is found that both ethanol and biodiesel production has shown net energy gain and reductions in GHG emissions which indicates sustainability and, therefore, could be good substitutes for petroleum fuels if their production pathways are properly managed and implemented. Flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) fuelled with a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline (E85) could save 65% fossil fuels and 29% of GHG emission reductions compared to neat gasoline vehicles. Compared to neat diesel vehicles, a blend of 20% biodiesel and 80% diesel (B20) powered vehicles could save 15% fossil energy and could remove 12% of GHG emissions per kilometre driven. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) with biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel), gasoline, and diesel showed higher savings of fossil fuel energy and less GHG emissions in every scenario. © 2021 The Authors","Biofuels; Ethiopia; Greenhouse gas emissions; Total energy use; Well-to-wheels","Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Blending; Diesel engines; Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy security; Energy utilization; Ethanol fuels; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Petroleum transportation; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Energy use; Energy-consumption; Ethiopia; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle energies; Petroleum fuels; Total energy; Total energy use; Well-to-wheel; Ethanol","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (2017GXZ018399)","This work was supported by China Scholarship Council under grant (2017GXZ018399).

We investigate the potential for PEV adoption in India, the challenges in meeting the country's goals and ways to overcome them. We utilize a survey of 51 experts in the Indian light-duty vehicle (LDV) ecosystem to address these questions. The majority of experts indicate that India will marginally miss its 30% PEV sales target by 2030. The main reasons cited for this are PEVs’ high upfront cost, a lack of policies promoting PEVs and a lack of charging infrastructure. Experts believe lack of domestic PEV battery and manufacturing supply chains will limit the supply of low-cost PEVs to the Indian market. The lack of land availability and high land rent prices in Indian cities is cited as the major barrier to the establishment of charging infrastructure. The experts view a PEV sales mandate and incentives, such as ‘feebates,’ as the most effective policy levers, while believing a ban on conventional vehicle sales by 2030 was unlikely. The findings hold significance for understanding the future of India's LDV sector and the associated energy and environmental impacts, which have global implications. © 2021 The Authors","Demand-side barriers to PEV adoption; Expert survey; PEV adoption; Policy levers for PEV adoption; Societal gains from PEV adoption; Supply-side barriers to PEV adoption","Charging (batteries); Climate change; Costs; Energy security; Environmental impact; Plug-in electric vehicles; Sales; Supply chains; Charging infrastructures; Demand-side barrier to plug-in electric vehicle adoption; Energy; Expert survey; Light duty vehicles; Plug-in electric vehicle adoption; Plug-ins; Policy lever for plug-in electric vehicle adoption; Societal gain from plug-in electric vehicle adoption; Supply-side barrier to plug-in electric vehicle adoption; Surveys","","","R.

The first objective of the paper is to present the model, including the 2-layer calibration that has been carried out for assuring energy balance using official statistics. The second objective of the paper is to demonstrate the use of the model to develop greenhouse gas mitigation scenarios based on policies including: (i) improved fuel efficiency of vehicles; (ii) improved vehicle inspections; (iii) the scaling up of low-carbon technologies including hybrid and electric vehicles, as well as the use of bioethanol produced in Mauritius; and (iv) the proposed light-rail system in Mauritius. The results show that the ‘business-as-usual’ land transport emissions are expected to reach ~1.68 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2050. The combination of all scenarios could result in ~0.31 MtCO2e reductions by 2050, with over 57% of all reductions are expected to accrue from (iii). Since energy used in transport makes up for more than 56% of the primary energy requirement of Mauritius, the macroeconomic effects of decarbonizing land transport is significant from an energy security standpoint.

Further, it is argued that the approach would be useful in the context of other small islands developing states that face land availability constraints like Mauritius. © 2021 The Authors","Climate change mitigation; Land transport emissions; Travel demand","","","","P.N.K.

Before penetrating a large number of electric vehicles (EV) into the power grid, a thorough investigation and assessment of significant parameters are required, as additional nonlinear and EV loads are linked to the decentralized market. Many automobile companies have already invested in electric vehicle research; hence, a detailed analysis on range anxiety and grid connectivity concerns are the important factors affecting the future of the electric vehicle industry. In this paper, the initial review is about the decentralized market in India and sustainable aspects of electric mobility based on the Indian context, as it is a developing nation with an enormous resource and scope for EV markets. With recent literature from the last three years, the substantial constraints observed in benefits and challenges are reviewed. The financial stability aspects and the incentives to overcome the barriers to EV adoption are briefly discussed. From the review, it has come to the limelight that infrastructure availability, technology, load demand, and consumer behaviour are all major obstacles in the electric vehicle ecosystem. For the overall design and study of the vehicle to grid (V2G) infrastructure, this paper also provides insight into the representation of electric vehicles in different energy-efficient models and their categorization while connecting to the grid. The methodology adopted for energy-efficient models includes lifecycle emissions, economy, smart charging, real-time optimization, aggregated EV resource modelling, and a support vector machine (SVM)-based method. This paper gives a positive impact on EV fleet integration and electric mobility in general, as it critically reviews the influential parameters and challenges. This classification depends on crucial parameters that are at the frontline of EV grid integration research. This review is a solution to enhance grid stability in regard to new EV models. With the advanced electric motors development and renewed battery technology models, longer-distance automobiles are now available on the market. This paper investigates the constraints of EV grid integration and analyzes different EV models to ease the grid stability for a decentralized market. © 2022 by the authors.","decentralized market; demand-side management (DSM); distributed energy storage (DES); electric vehicle (EV); smart charging; vehicle to grid (V2G)","Air quality; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Life cycle; Lime; Solar power generation; Support vector machines; Vehicle-to-grid; Decentralised; Decentralized market; Demand-side management; Distributed energy storage; Distributed energy storages; Electric vehicle; Smart charging; Vehicle modelling; Vehicle to grid (V2G); Electric vehicles","","","P.K.

Numerous options exist for immediate, deep, and sustained efforts to realise a 43% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Beyond the recent reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this editorial extends insight into new research advances for integrated approaches that can support effective climate mitigation. Based on the 16th Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water, and Environment Systems, the review in this editorial interconnects the 28 research articles in this special issue within a broader context across eight main themes. The first theme on 100% renewable energy systems emphasizes recent advances in modelling and sector coupling, extending to the optimization of positive energy districts and energy communities at the local level and ultra-low temperature district heating and cooling networks. Energy security with sustainable energy solutions involves electrification, renewable energy, and energy savings. Transforming transport for energy transition solutions and new frontiers in renewable energy technologies cover advances for smart energy districts, electric vehicles, accurate forecasting of long-term wind speed, hydrogen propulsion in marine vessels, and innovations for water quality monitoring. System restructuring for the energy transition is supported with research contributions on time variability and environmental signalling in electricity markets, dedicated price structures for energy community trading, flexibilisation, and repurposing drilling sites for deep geothermal energy. Thematically, upgrading of biomass for biofuel production, green hydrogen innovations and heat transfer as well sustainable combustion complete the special issue. New catalysts, hybrid reaction for lignocellulosic biofuels, hydrogen fuel cell electrocatalyst, and waste heat recovery from granules in concentrating solar power or slags are some of the research advances under these themes. The widespread upscaling of solutions for mitigating climate change requires an effective approach that involves integrated, coordinated, and synergistic action now as the only chance for better protecting the life-support systems of the planet. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Climate mitigation; Environment; Renewable energy; Sector coupling; Sustainable development; Water","","American International College; Combustion Institute; Croatian Academy of Engineering; European Research Centre; International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems • University of Zagreb; Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts; Mediterranean Network for Engineering Schools and Technical Universities; Nuclear Sciences, Belgrade, Serbia • Warsaw University of Technology; RMEI; Slovenian Association; The World Academy of Art and Science • Croatian Commission; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro; University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia • Brno University of Technology; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO; Cyprus University of Technology, CUT; Hague University of Applied Sciences, THUAS; Univerzitet u Sarajevu, UNSA; Xi’an Jiaotong University, XJTU; KU Leuven; Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK; Instituto Superior Técnico, IST","The success of the 16th Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems is the result of the orchestrated effort of the International SDEWES Centre as the executive organizer together with cooperating scientific and academic institutions.

Introduction of electric vehicles in the market is a step in the right direction for the forward march towards energy security and reduction of carbon footprint. Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries are popular for the use in electric vehicles, because of their high energy density, long cycle life and so on. The cell temperature has a significant impact on the reliability, safety and lifespan of these batteries, making thermal assessment of battery inevitable for its use in various applications. Phase change material (PCM) based thermal management is highly promising in this regard. Overcoming the low thermal conductivity of these materials is the key challenge in the development of a PCM-based battery thermal management system (BTMS). Apart from focussing on various aspects of Li-ion battery and PCM, the main thrust of this review paper is on providing necessary details of various thermal conductivity enhancing techniques used in tandem with PCMs. The thermal conductivity enhancers discussed are: metal fins, metal foams, metal mesh, carbon fibre, carbon nanotubes, graphene and expanded graphite. Machine learning techniques employed for multi - scale modelling of PCM based Li-ion battery thermal management were also discussed. This review mainly focusses on the literature published in the last five years in order to provide new insights to the development of Li-ion battery thermal management using various PCM-thermal conductivity enhancer combinations.

To the best of our knowledge, cyberattacks, especially sophisticated and subtle cyberattacks, have not yet been studied in energy management systems (EMSs) for HEVs. First of all, we present a systemic assessment of long-term sophisticated cyberattacks that aim to deteriorate the battery lifetime and energy efficiency of HEVs. Specifically, three levels of attack taxonomy according to the skill level of the attackers are considered, which are sophisticated and can hardly be detected by the human driver. In addition to levels 1 and 2, cyberattacks that do not or partially require prior knowledge of the vehicle, and we explore two other types of level 3 damage-oriented controller attacks made by highly skilled attackers who have sufficient knowledge of the system. Such sophisticated attacks will potentially cause severe damages, such as decreasing battery capacity and energy by up to 50%. For a comprehensive vulnerability assessment, we propose innovative evaluation metrics to analyze the impact and stealthiness of sophisticated attacks. Finally, a preliminary probability-based detection method for sophisticated damage-oriented controller attacks is developed to improve the cyber-physical security of energy-efficient powertrain system in HEVs.  © 2015 IEEE.","Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); sophisticated attacks; vehicle cyber-physical security; vehicle powertrain systems; vulnerability assessment","Computer crime; Crime; Cyber Physical System; Damage detection; Energy efficiency; Energy management systems; Energy security; Network security; Powertrains; Secondary batteries; Cyber-Physical securities; Detection methods; Energy efficient; Evaluation metrics; Innovative approaches; Power-train systems; Systemic assessment; Vulnerability assessments; Hybrid vehicles","National Science Foundation, NSF, (ECCS-1946057)","Manuscript received July 7, 2020; revised August 10, 2020; accepted September 4, 2020.

Rigorous efforts have been made to make electric vehicles (EVs) feasible for commercial use. However, despite of many efforts by the Government of India, the rate of adoption of EVs in India has not been up to the mark. To bridge this gap, present study understands the social acceptability and sustainability of EVs and identifies the social factors, builds inferences from the results obtained and helps in orienting the manufacturers and decision makers towards faster adoption of the EVs. Design/methodology/approach: The social factors responsible for the growth of EVs in India are identified by literature survey. A questionnaire has been developed for understanding the customer’s perception towards EVs. The results of the survey are analysed using the tools on descriptive statistics, structural equation model using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and hypothesis testing and the results are validated. Findings: The results of the study are based on three hypotheses. The findings show that although the financial and the infrastructure factors have positive impact on rate of adoption of EVs in India; the vehicle performance factors have a negative impact on EVs adoption, implying that the respondents of the survey who feel that the vehicle performance factors are the most imperative have a more passive mind-set towards the EVs adoption. Research limitations/implications: The research work is based on the survey conducted on the pilot region of the national capital region of the country where the majority of the respondents of the survey are conventional fossil fuel vehicles (CFFV) owners. A more accurate analysis on the social factors affecting deployment of EVs in the Indian market can be done if the population of the survey consists of equal share of CFFV and EV owners from all across the nation. Practical implications: This study will help researchers get a better understanding of the reasons for slow adoption rate of EVs in India. This paper sheds light upon the social factors responsible for the same. The Government of India can use the results of this study to understand the factors responsible for non-adoption and the recommendations for its further work on “Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) and Electric Vehicles” India scheme. Social implications: Results of the study identifies the factors that slow down the adoption rate of EVs in India. The paper suggested potential solutions for the same. Successful implementation in terms of policies and technological advancements can propel India to the top in EV market. Switching to EVs brings about a radical change in the social life of the people and can improve the social status and lifestyle of the people. Originality/value: Existing research has not focussed much on the social aspects of EVs in India. The present work is solely the result of the strategic thinking, planning, work and implementation by the authors. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CO<sub>2</sub> emission; Decision-making; Descriptive statistics; Electric vehicles; Environmental damages; Fossil fuel; Hypothesis testing; Interviews; Mail questionnaires; Online surveys; Policy; Regression; Social factors; Structural equation model; Surveys; Transport","Commercial vehicles; Economic and social effects; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Industrial research; Surveys; Sustainable development; Vehicle performance; CO 2 emission; Decisions makings; Descriptive statistics; Environmental damage; Hypothesis testing; Interview; Mail questionnaires; Online surveys; Regression; Social factor; Structural equation models; Transport; Decision making","IMPRESS-ICSSR, New Delhi India","The authors would like to acknowledge the reviewers for their constructive and helpful comments.

Therefore, it is essential to carry out smart scheduling for charging and discharging of EVs. In this paper, a residential parking-lot scheme using 200 EVs as an example is developed to schedule the charging and discharging of EVs which is based on the initial and final value of the State Of Charge (SOC) of all EVs requested by the owner one day in advance, and the information the expected arrival and departure time to the parking-lot. However, errors most probably exist in this scheme where owners' requests cannot be met because of random behaviours of the other EV owners which will require the imposition of penalty. An optimisation problem is formulated to maximise the Smart Parking-Lot (SPL) profit considering random behaviours EV owners and the penalty imposed. In this paper, the aim is achieved by defining some random behaviours and penalty flexibility. The related optimising problem is solved by using the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through four different scenarios; in the first scenario, some random behaviours of EV owners are considered. In the last three scenarios, some flexibilities in penalising of the EV owners have been considered. The simulation results of all scenarios are compared and used to demonstrate the features of the proposed scheduling method.  © 2021 IEEE.","Electric Vehicle (EV); Optimal scheduling; Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO); Random behaviours; Smart Parking-Lot (SPL); Vehicle owners","Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Energy security; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Random errors; Electric vehicle; Electric vehicle charging; Large penetrations; Optimal scheduling; Parking lots; Particle swarm optimization; Random behavior; Smart parking lots; Smart parking-lot; Vehicle owner; Scheduling","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166544389-0","","","English","Int.

Due to this, electrification of the transport sector has become an achievable solution that has caught attention with increasing penetration in the market share. India is a participant in the Paris Agreement which aims to curtail the production of greenhouse gases and limit the escalating temperature. Public intervention and changes in policy and regulations are the key aspects of this technological transition. Compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) engine-based vehicles, the consumers’ frame of mind concerns about adapting to e-mobility is anxiety over charging times and driving range. Thus, the development of charging stations plays a crucial role in promoting electric vehicles (EVs). This study investigates to identify different barriers that exist in the Indian context related to the adoption of e-mobility. Furthermore, this work emphasizes the recent developments in charging infrastructure planning in India. Also, the status of the installed charging stations is examined. Developing appropriate charging stations are associated with several challenges which are also highlighted to provide guidance to public and private entities that can be adopted in their respective business model. The low EV adoption rate is considerably low compared to other countries having the second largest population and seventh largest country; there is a long path to match the growth rate. Hence it becomes essential to develop a robust and suitable charging infrastructure to promote the sale and use of EVs in India. © 2022 Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Charging infrastructure planning; E-mobility; Electric vehicle; Government initiatives; Market player; Vehicle to grid (V2G)","India; electric vehicle; electrification; greenhouse gas; infrastructure planning; mobility; technology adoption","","","S.

This energy balance brings a massive problem for the import intensity; therefore, e-mobility might be a potential solution for the trade deficits of many European countries. Battery Electric Vehicles and Plug-In Hybrid Electric vehicles have been introduced within the priorities of the EC but also by car manufacturing companies worldwide. By 2050, massive growth of Electric vehicles (EVs) is expected, and significant changes in favour of electric cars have to be observed in new car sales till 2030. The article's main objective is to investigate whether and to what extent new sales of e-cars bring lower oil imports to Slovakia. The authors use three scenarios (based on regression models) differentiating market force intensity and regulation stringency till 2030. The significant findings of the models provide an estimated number of EVs on Slovak roads in 2030 and significant oil import cuts stemming from oil import substitution. The conclusion suggests that by 2030, Slovak oil imports will only slightly decrease due to e-mobility penetration, even in the most optimistic scenario. © 2022 The Authors.

The integration of Information and Communication Technologies with power grids fosters seamless data sharing between different SG entities, which supports effective and smart governance in terms of demand response management, frequency support, and voltage stabilization. Nonetheless, this integration opens up several security and privacy concerns, namely, electricity theft, power loss, battery exhaustion, infrastructure mapping, etc. These issues become even more important with the addition of distributed energy sources, e.g. electric vehicles (EVs), battery energy storage systems, and renewable energy sources, into the SGs. We present a framework based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) and BlockChain (BC) to address two challenging issues of EV-aided SG ecosystems, namely, privacy assurance and power security. We leverage the capabilities of SDN to handle the complex interactions between different subsystems of the SG. Furthermore, we also employ BC and smart contracts' properties to secure energy transactions and data communications. We design a secure and efficient mutual authentication protocol based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and BC for privacy preservation during smart energy trading. We also proposed a BC-based smart contract for effective Demand Response Management (DRM) during bidirectional energy transfer between EVs and SG. Finally, we present experimental evaluations to validate the proposed framework's performance. The results obtained demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed scheme compared with current state-of-the-art approaches. The mutual authentication protocol designed is not only secure against major attack vectors (namely, session key security, message integrity, anonymity, forward secrecy, and so on), but it is also cost-efficient in terms of communication and computational costs. Additionally, the SC designed assures power security and maintains an adequate balance between demand and supply. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Blockchain; electric vehicles; energy security; Ethereum; privacy; smart contract; smart grid","Authentication; Blockchain; Chromium compounds; Cyber Physical System; Data Sharing; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Electric energy storage; Electric losses; Embedded systems; Information management; Privacy by design; Public key cryptography; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery energy storage systems; Cyber-Physical securities; Distributed energy sources; Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC); Information and Communication Technologies; Mutual authentication protocols; Software defined networking (SDN); State-of-the-art approach; Electric power transmission networks","Tier 2 Canada Research Chair on the Next Generations of Wireless IoT Networks; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Manuscript received April 27, 2020; revised October 6, 2020; accepted November 23, 2020.

Environmental pollution, fuel demand, and the current energy crisis stimulate the need to develop an alternative energy source. Fuel cell technology has proven to be a promising solution for energy security and environmental concerns. However, fuel cells are subjected to uncertain challenges that hinder their market feasibility. The challenges include the cost of the stack attributed to the expensive components, followed by the technical and economic challenges associated with the thermal and water management. The present work reviews the recent progress on a critical factor that degrades the performance of fuel cells, including water accumulation and thermal management. Different heat transfer approaches are compared with advanced technologies reported and various thermal management systems researched in recent days are discussed. Uneven water distribution in the stack tends to corrode the materials, leading to high parasitic loss in the electrochemical region and thus affecting the life of the stack. To overcome this effect and maintain an optimum temperature distribution in the fuel cell, various thermal management techniques are being studied. Inappropriate thermal management that leads to water flooding issues in fuel cell electric vehicles is also discussed. With the aid of a comprehensive review, it is established that a liquid cooling system using nanofluid as coolant could be an ideal option for thermal management of PEMFC cooling that could balance the water management and operating temperature for optimum stack performance. © 2022","Flooding; Membrane dryness; Nanofluids; PEM fuel cell; Thermal management; Water management","Energy policy; Energy security; Environmental technology; Floods; Heat transfer; Oil well flooding; Polyelectrolytes; Temperature control; Water management; Water supply systems; Energy industry; Energy transitions; Environmental pollutions; Floodings; Global energy; Membrane dryness; Nanofluids; PEM fuel cell; Thermal and water management; Waters managements; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)","SRM Institute of Science and Technology, SRMIST","The authors would like to express their gratitude to the Department of Mechanical Engineering of SRM Institute of Science & Technology, Kattankulathur, India for their support in this work.","P.

The transition to electric mobility is a sustainable solution to mitigate the negative impact on the environment and energy security. In recent years, global sales of electric vehicles (EVs) have grown steadily; however, their worldwide market share is still less than 10%. The present study aims to improve and strengthen the knowledge base on consumer behavior toward EV purchases by investigating the antecedents of EV purchase intention, as well as their impact. This paper is based on a systematic literature review where 63 articles published between 1994 and 2021 were analyzed. The antecedents were classified into three main categories: consumer characteristics, EV characteristics, and EV-related policies. A summary model represents the impact information of each of the main antecedents. The descriptive results of the sample are also discussed. Finally, this study indicates directions for future research and recommendations for developing the most effective strategies and policies that will accelerate the transition to a more sustainable future. © 2023 by the authors.","antecedents of purchase intention; electric vehicles; purchase intention; sustainable mobility; systematic literature review","antecedent conditions; consumption behavior; development strategy; electric vehicle; literature review; mobility; research and development; sustainability","","","A.C.

Through the transition theory lens, we review the national policy measures and broad clean transportation targets that small island countries are implementing to encourage electric mobility deployment. From information compiled for 18 small island countries, we find a growing trend in electric vehicle and infrastructure development incentives among broader clean transportation transformation policies and nationally determined contribution targets; and large country-to-country variations in enabling conditions to smoothen EV transition. Small island countries are not uniform but instead are very dispersed across the transition S-curve. The review, therefore, finds that the mobility transition requires island-specific approaches and solutions that will accentuate critical policy and management elements for fostering transitions.

This is very closely linked with energy security and economy of that country. The highly dependence to fossil fuel extracts and their depletion in reserves has forced mankind to adopt Energy Efficiency as a sustainable alternative. Mobility plays a vital role in bringing development to a country, which itself holds a prominent share of overall energy demand. Fuel switching to electricity for mobility is reliable and convenient to users only with a highly dependent infrastructure at highway and urban road networks for charging the Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries during the daily run. The need for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) at key locations of a highway network ensures a reliable long trip for personal and public needs. The source of power to feed these EVCS shall be the utility grid itself which can open new challenges with respect to impact in the power system as well as transport route planning. Hence an optimal placement of EVCS to Utility grid mapped to the present transport network shall play a vital role. If not placed suitably to the utility grid, these highly dynamic loads may result in increased losses, voltage drops and result in loss of power system reliability. The placement of EVCS at suitable locations depends on statutory norms, optimal power flow, EV range considerations, and various other factors. A case study of optimal placement technique for EVCS to Kerala state highway network fed by Kerala state power system network for a stable operation of power system is discussed. © 2022 IEEE","Charging Stations; Electric Vehicles; Genetic Algorithm; Optimal Placement; Power Loss; State Highway; Transportation Network; Utility grid; Voltage drop","Charging (batteries); Electric load flow; Electric losses; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Proven reserves; Vehicle-to-grid; Case-studies; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Highway networks; Optimal placements; Powerloss; State highways; Transportation network; Utility grids; Voltage drop; Genetic algorithms","Department of Electrical Engineering; Department of Power; Energy Efficiency Services Ltd.; Kerala State Electricity Board Limited","The authors express their sincere thanks to Department of Electrical Engineering - College of Engineering Trivandrum, Energy Management Centre - Kerala (EMC), Department of Power, Govt of Kerala, Kerala State Electricity Board Limited (KSEBL) and Energy Efficiency Services Ltd.

Motorized two-wheelers (M2W) are the popular means of personal mobility, and are accounting for nearly 32% of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions in India. In this regard, replacing existing M2W with alternative fuelled vehicles such as the Electric Two-Wheelers (E2W) could significantly minimize the negative implications associated with the usage of M2W. Therefore, this study has attempted to identify and prioritize the key E2W specific attributes to propose necessary policy-level interventions for projecting E2W as an attractive alternative. Initially, an exhaustive set of twenty-three attributes influencing E2W-usage were identified from the literature. Subsequently, experts' opinions and users' perceptions on the importance of the identified attributes were captured and analyzed using appropriate Multi-Criteria-Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to analyze experts' opinions. The RIDIT (Relative to an Identified Distribution and Transformation) method was used to analyze users' perceptions. Finally, both sets of results are compared and combined to derive key E2W specific attributes based on their perceived importance by experts and users. Results indicate that the following attributes, namely, purchase cost and operation cost (Economy-related), range, top speed, battery-charging duration, and acceleration (Vehicle and battery-related), health benefits and reduction in tailpipe emission (User-perceived benefit-related), and charging infrastructure, and parking infrastructure (Transport infrastructure-related) are perceived as the key attributes influencing E2W in the typical Indian context. Based on the results, it is recommended that E2W with a longer range, higher speed, and faster acceleration rate could be promoted as a sustainable alternative to conventional M2W. The provision of adequate charging and parking infrastructure was critical for E2W usage in the Indian context. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Electric two-wheeler; Expert-opinion; Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM); Prioritization; User-perception","","","","B.B.

This EV-adoption process is a complex system that considers the relationships between the dimensions of sustainability, car-ownership transition to EVs, market dynamics, and the government. Several models have been designed to address this system. However, these models have only partially developed these relationships because they did not consider all the components or relationships between the elements of this process. This article proposes a systemic approach based on previous models, which integrates all the components and relationships and incorporates the analysis of sustainability into the EV-adoption process. The system structure of this EV-adoption process is presented and discussed. This approach deepens the understanding of the synergies between market dynamics and sustainability, allowing to model the system more broadly. It can thus help in the sustainable and integrated evaluation of different policy scenarios, thereby contributing to a clearer understanding of the dynamic behavior and leverage points of the system. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","causal loop diagram; conceptual model; EV adoption; system structure; system thinking","","Colombian Department of Science, Technology and Innovation; Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS), (757–2016); Universidad de La Sabana, (ING-215-2018)","This research was funded by the Colombian Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (Colciencias) under award number 757–2016 and by Universidad de La Sabana, Colombia, under Research Project No. ING-215-2018.

In particular, electric vehicles (EVs) are the most promising solution due to the fact that the electrical power system is the most ready infrastructure to supply their requirement. Two possible energy delivery solutions to the EVs, namely the charging stations and the battery exchange stations (BESs) are the focus of research nowadays. In this paper, a new optimal operation approach is proposed for the BESs. The proposed new model determines the optimal charging, discharging, and exchange decisions for the battery stock throughout the day taking into consideration the customers’ arrivals, the variations in the grid price, the grid connection limitations, and the self-degradation of the batteries. The objective of the proposed approach is to maximize the BES owner profit while satisfying the EV owners’ requests. The BES operation optimization problem is formulated as mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem and is solved as a day-ahead scheme. The performance of the BES is compared to conventional EV charging stations, where the BES shows superior customer satisfaction and higher profit. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Battery exchange stations; Charging stations; Electric vehicles; Optimization; Smart Grid","Automotive batteries; Customer satisfaction; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Integer programming; Profitability; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electrical power system; Ev charging stations; Focus of researches; Low emission vehicles; Mixed integer programming (MIP); Operation optimization; Optimal operation; Charging (batteries)","","","M.

This unprecedented crisis requires deeper analyses and well-measured actions from the main actors in Norway's energy and climate sector. Hence, providing and highlighting needed interventions and improvements in the energy system is crucial. This study analyzes demand-side energy in Norway's households, industry, transport, and “other” sectors. LEAP model, a powerful energy system analysis tool, was used to conduct the analysis based on Baseline and Mitigation scenarios. The energy demand by sector and fuel type toward 2050 is forecasted, firstly by considering a set of parameters and key assumptions that impact the security of supply and secondly on the ambitious target of Norway's government in decreasing GHG emissions by 55% in 2030 and 90–95% by the year 2050 compared to 1990 levels. The mitigation scenario aims to diversify the overall national energy system and technological changes based on large-scale renewable energy sources (RES) integration. From the perspective of climate change issues, EV's include an attractive option for deep decarbonization, including other sustainable fuel sources such as H2, biofuel mixed with diesel, the use of excess heat deriving from industry to cover households' heating demand, and integration of large-scale heat pumps driven by RES during off-peak demand is applied. Energy demand projections are uncertain, and the main goal is to show how different scenario projections up to 2050 affect the whole of Norway's energy system, leading to a combined global warming potential (GWP) of around 7.30 MtCO2 in the mitigation scenario from 56.40 MtCO2 tones released in the baseline scenario, by reaching only 77.5% reduction referring to 1990 level. This study's findings show that the net-zero ambitions by the end of 2050 are impossible without the carbon tax application and carbon capture storage (CCS), especially in the oil and gas industry. © 2023 The Authors","Energy demand; Energy policy; Energy system analysis; Energy transition; LEAP model","Norway; Biofuels; Carbon capture; Energy policy; Energy security; Gas industry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Systems analysis; Energy; Energy demand projections; Energy demands; Energy systems; Energy systems analysis; Energy transitions; Future energies; Large-scales; LEAP model; Renewable energy source; alternative energy; biofuel; climate change; emission control; energy policy; environmental issue; future prospect; global warming; government; mitigation; pollution tax; Investments","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/04625/2020)","Alban Kuriqi is grateful for the Foundation for Science and Technology's support through funding UIDB/04625/2020 from the research unit CERIS .","A.

We find that heavy dependence on lithium will create energy security risks because China has a dominant position in the lithium supply chain and both Europe and North America seek to curtail reliance on China throughout their supply chains. We also find that efforts to expand lithium mining have been much less successful in Chile, the United States, and Europe than in Australia. Local communities resist licensing of new lithium mines due to a variety of environmental, social, and economic concerns. There are alternative technologies that may make lithium mining more sustainable such as direct lithium extraction, but the timing of commercialization of this process is uncertain. Progress is also being made in battery recycling and in alternative battery designs that do not use lithium. Such advances are unlikely to attenuate the global rate of growth in lithium demand prior to 2030. We conclude that tradeoffs between sustainability and energy security are real, especially in the next decade. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition to concerns about energy security and greenhouse gas emissions, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are also becoming more popular due to their low cost of ownership and low power consumption. As electric vehicle battery capacity and range of EVs improve, electric vehicles may require fast charging. Photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy are proposed as energy sources in this paper.The MPPT control is used to provide maximum power tracking for PV System, as well as to transmit that maximum power to the batteries of a Hybrid Energy system via the Battery Management System (BMS). Energy produced by solar PV and wind power systems can be stored in energy storage systems and used for propulsion, and a battery management system (BMS) helps to track the battery's Temperature, Current, Voltage, and State of Charge (SOC).Basically the paper deals with the increasing the range of the Battery using Hybrid PV Wind system with Battery Management System where PV system and Wind system are integrated using Battery Management System. The main reason BMS is used is to check the State of Charge(SOC) of the battery because the battery is very costly in the EVs so, the utmost care is given to the Battery. © 2022 IEEE.","Battery Management System Solar PV Array; Hybrid System; Solar Panels; State of Charge(SOC)","Automotive industry; Charging (batteries); Energy management systems; Energy policy; Energy security; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Lead acid batteries; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Solar panels; Vehicle-to-grid; Wind power; Battery management system solar photovoltaic array; Hybrid photovoltaics; Oil and gas; Oil resource; Photovoltaic arrays; Photovoltaic systems; Solar panels; Solar photovoltaics; States of charges; Wind systems; Battery management systems","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166541120-2","","","English","Int.

The maintenance of daily economic activities would not be possible without assurance of energy security, which is also a critical contributor to sustainable energy. The European Union (EU) strives to protect the energy security of its members in order to prevent supply problems or crises. The main purpose of our analysis is to evaluate the energy security of EU countries by analyzing their performance, productivity, and relationship with economic growth. Using hybrid and comparative MCDM and Malmquist productivity approaches, we assess the static and dynamic energy security performance of the EU countries in the period from 2014 to 2018. We use IDOCRIW-weighted SAW, MARCOS, and CODAS techniques for static performance measurement and the Malmquist productivity approach for dynamic performance evaluation. Considering both static and dynamic performance among developed EU countries, Denmark is found to be superior. Further, the Malmquist productivity index results indicate a slight improvement for developed countries and deterioration for developing countries. According to the panel data analysis, energy security is a factor that leads to economic growth. Consequently, energy efficiency initiatives such as efficiency action plans, hybrid and electric vehicles, and energy storage advancements play crucial roles in enhancing the EU's energy security. © 2023 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","energy security; European Union; Malmquist Productivity Index; Multi-criteria decision-making; panel data","Decision making; Deterioration; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy security; MATLAB; Economic growths; European union; European Union countries; Malmquist; Malmquist productivity index; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Panel data; Security performance; Developing countries","","","F.

The environmental performance of electric vehicles is heavily dependent on the energy structure which is undergoing a profound transition. Moreover, the deployment of electric vehicles is critically affected by policies. In this context, this study investigated the impact of energy structure transition and penetration uncertainty on emissions of electric vehicles in Japan from 2000 to 2030. The results suggested that the greenhouse gas and reactive nitrogen were mitigated for both energy sources of electricity mix transition and ammonia energy carrier compared with the baseline. Trade-off between the electricity mix transition and ammonia energy carrier scenarios was observed. Specifically, the electricity mix transition results demonstrated a more significant emission reduction of reactive nitrogen, while an ammonia energy carrier led to a more significant emission reduction of greenhouse gas. Finally, key policy implications were summarized by providing insights into energy portfolio planning and electric vehicle deployment from the perspective of climate change mitigation and sustainable reactive nitrogen management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Emission reduction; Greenhouse gas; Policy implications; Reactive nitrogen","Ammonia; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy security; Environmental management; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Public policy; Climate change mitigation; Emission reduction; Energy portfolio; Energy structures; Environmental performance; Reactive nitrogen; Sustainable mobility; Vehicle electrifications; Electric automobiles","","","M.

This study presents a well-to-wheel (WTW) analysis to estimate the WTW fossil fuel consumption, GHG emission and air pollutants emissions of VOCs, CO, NOx, SOx, PM2.5 and PM10 for HFCV under 12 hydrogen pathways in China for the current (2017) and near future (2030). The results were compared with the gasoline-fueled internal combustion engine vehicle (gasoline-ICEV) and battery electric vehicle (BEV) counterparts. The results show that HFCV can reduce 11–92% fossil fuel consumption compared with gasoline-ICEV in 2017, with one exception that HFCV based on on-site water electrolysis by grid electricity in which fossil fuel consumption increased by 10% instead. Compared with BEV, HFCV based on by-product hydrogen from chlor-alkali process and renewable water electrolysis have the fossil fuel consumption reduction benefits. Regarding GHG emissions, HFCV based on water electrolysis using the renewable electricity performs the best with a value of 31 g CO2-eq/km while that based on on-site water electrolysis using grid electricity performs the worst with a value of 431 g CO2-eq/km in 2017. For air pollutants, HFCV based on all hydrogen pathways can achieve a significant reduction of VOCs and CO emissions on a WTW basis, in comparison with gasoline-ICEV in 2017. In terms of NOx, SOx, PM2.5 and PM10, HFCV based on on-site water electrolysis by grid electricity electrolysis has the highest emissions due to high emission factors of the electricity generation process. Moreover, due to increased share of renewable electricity and improvement in the fuel economy, reductions in WTW fossil fuel consumption and pollutants emissions are excepted by 2030. This study indicates the importance of hydrogen production when considering the energy and environment performance of HFCV to ensure a life cycle low carbon and air pollutants emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; Energy consumption; Greenhouse gas emission; Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle; Well-to-wheel analysis","Air pollution; Artificial life; Battery electric vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Electric power transmission networks; Electrolysis; Energy security; Energy utilization; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Gas fuel analysis; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Life cycle; Nitrogen oxides; Vehicle-to-grid; Wheels; Electricity generation; Energy and environment; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Renewable electricity; Transportation sector; Well-to-wheel analysis; Fossil fuels","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201707040082)","The first author acknowledges the support of China Scholarship council (no. 201707040082).

Effective implementation of these policies requires a comprehensive evaluation of CEVs. Decision-makers need to take into account multiple criteria such as energy performance, energy cost, vehicular emission, market acceptance and energy security. This paper proposes a decision support model, which applies multi-criteria analysis to prioritize CEVs existing and to be launched on the Chinese market. Government officials, academic researchers and industrial executives are interviewed to select and rank criteria for optimizing decision-making using the Analytic Hierarchy Process and the VIKOR optimization techniques. Thirty-five experts have been interviewed for prioritizing four categories of CEVs including electric, gas, methanol and ethanol vehicles from both the national and provincial perspectives. Results demonstrate that electric vehicles represent the highest ranking, followed by gas, methanol and ethanol vehicles. The proposed model has been validated using statistical data and existing government policies. The proposed multi-criteria analysis can be used for advising decision-makers in the area of clean energy vehicles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic hierarchy process; Clean energy vehicles; Multi-criteria analysis; VIKOR","China; Analytic hierarchy process; Commerce; Decision making; Decision support systems; Energy security; Ethanol; Gas emissions; Methanol; Vehicles; Clean energy vehicles; Comprehensive evaluation; Decision support models; Environmental issues; Government officials; Multi Criteria Analysis; Optimization techniques; VIKOR; analytical hierarchy process; decision making; energy market; energy use; multicriteria analysis; optimization; policy implementation; transport vehicle; Public policy","","","M.

However, these generators often suffer from intermittency and require energy storage when there is over-generation and the subsequent release of this stored energy at high demand. One such energy storage technology that could provide a solution to improving energy management, as well as offering spinning reserve and grid stability, is the redox flow battery (RFB). One such system is the 200 kW/400 kWh vanadium RFB installed in the energy station at Martigny, Switzerland. This RFB utilises the excess energy from renewable generation to support the energy security of the local community, charge electric vehicle batteries, or to provide the power required to an alkaline electrolyser to produce hydrogen as a fuel for use in fuel cell vehicles. In this article, this vanadium RFB is fully characterised in terms of the system and electrochemical energy efficiency, with the focus being placed on areas of internal energy consumption from the regulatory systems and energy losses from self-discharge/side reactions. © 2018 by the authors.

As transport biofuels now only have a small share of the transport sector energy supply and the complexity in providing the fuels because of issues related to available land and food security, this paper develops conversion path solutions for transport biofuel development based on a technological paradigm study. A data-driven approaches system (DAS) that combines visualization analyses with technological paradigm theory is proposed to reveal the key areas and trends in transport biofuels. Timeline, timezones, and cluster visualizations identified the transport biofuel technological paradigm (TBTP) from current transport biofuel developments; a pre-shift phase (including TBTP competition and TBTP diffusion) and a shift phase (TBTP shift), which respectively relate to conventional biofuels, advanced biofuels, and biofuel cells. However, from further DAS trend analyses and the practical findings, electric energy trends were revealed, indicating that there was a paradigm shift from the biofuel paradigm to a bio-electric energy paradigm. From the developed bio-electric energy framework, both indirect and direct methods were found to have led to an this electric energy conversion to an e-bio fuel cell vehicle for fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) and bioelectricity for electric vehicles (EV), both of which can contribute to a low-carbon, sustainable transportation future. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-electric energy framework; Conversion approaches; Literature mining; Technological paradigm; Transport biofuels","Biological fuel cells; Climate change; Data visualization; Electrophysiology; Energy conversion; Energy security; Food supply; Fossil fuels; Vehicles; Visualization; Bio-electrics; Cluster visualization; Electric energy conversion; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Literature mining; Sustainable transportation; Technological paradigm; Visualization analysis; Biofuels","Funds for Creative Research Groups of China, (50221402); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201706240166); Sichuan University, SCU; Major State Basic Research Development Program of China, (2011CB201200); Graduate Student's Research and Innovation Fund of Sichuan University, (2018YJSY035)","Funding text 1: This research has been supported by State Key Development Program of (for) Basic Research of China ( 973 Program , Grant No. 2011CB201200 ), the Funds for Creative Research Groups of China (Grant No. 50221402 ), Graduate Student’s Research and Innovation Fund of Sichuan University (Grant No. 2018YJSY035 ), and the China Scholarship Council (Grant No. 201706240166 ).

The charging system consists of two diode bridge rectifiers, a power factor correction (PFC) boost circuit, a DC/AC converter, an LLC resonant converter, and a high frequency transformer. Constant current/constant voltage (CC/CV) control is employed for the DC/AC converter. The Level 3 charging system uses a three-phase source as input and its bi-directional converter is equipped with reactive power and DC bus voltage control.

Thus, both the state and local governments in China have launched some policies and incentives to accelerate the development of EVs and the EV industry. Do EVs can effectively solve these problems in short term, viewed from the fleet point? Based on China’s most up-to-date deployment plan for EVs, this paper analyzes the energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by China’s road transport sector in three different scenarios. The results indicate that, based on current planning, the energy consumption and GHG emissions of the whole fleet will peak in 2025 and 2027, at the level of around 403 mtoe (million tons of oil equivalent) and 1763 mt CO2 eq. (million tons of CO2 equivalent), respectively. The introduction of EVs will significantly reduce the reliance on fossil fuel in the long term, with increasing ownership, while, in the short term, the fuel economy regulation will still play a more important role. Policy makers should continually pay attention to this. Meanwhile, commercial vehicles, especially heavy-duty trucks will account for a bigger and bigger proportion in the energy consumption and GHG emissions of the whole fleet. Thus, to some extent the focus should shift from passenger vehicles to commercial vehicles. More measures could be implemented. © 2018 by the authors.","Electric vehicle; Energy consumption; Greenhouse gas emissions","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Energy utilization; Fleet operations; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Problem solving; Deployment plans; Effective solution; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Heavy duty trucks; Local government; Passenger vehicles; Policy makers; Road transport sectors; Commercial vehicles","","","H.

Electric vehicles (EV) have been recognized as a way to decrease CO2 emissions in the transportation sector. Still, the real benefit of EV's depends on the source of the energy. Solar energy has been established to become a viable source for environmentally friendly energy as the costs of solar panels have been decreasing. However, in northern areas the amount of solar energy is limited during wintertime, which complicates using solar energy as the only energy source. This article models two possible operational scenarios for energy consumption for EV charging, based on empirical data from charging station use in Latvia - one prioritizing energy security, the other - use of locally produced solar energy. The article then evaluates how both scenarios perform, by looking at the capacity for energy production from photovoltaics obtained from solar radiation data in Latvia and combining with an option of energy storage in batteries. It then assesses the costs for solar energy comparing with the energy price in the grid, to estimate the economic benefits of using solar energy for EV charging. The results of the research show that for northern regions like Latvia solar energy can be effectively used to bring down the energy costs by 31 % compared with the standard scenario, with the algorithm preferring local energy being more cost-efficient at the same grid connection level, but the security prioritizing algorithm performing better altogether, by allowing larger grid connection power level decrease. © 2019 Latvia University of Agriculture.

However, the realization of such a goal requires research and development across multiple levels, with battery technology being a key technical barrier. The present-day high-energy lithium-ion batteries with graphite anodes and transition metal oxide cathodes in liquid electrolytes are unable to achieve the fast-charging goal without negatively affecting electrochemical performance and safety. Here we discuss the challenges and future research directions towards fast charging at the level of battery materials from mass transport, charge transfer and thermal management perspectives. Moreover, we highlight advanced characterization techniques to fundamentally understand the failure mechanisms of batteries during fast charging, which in turn would inform more rational battery designs. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","","Charge transfer; Electrodes; Energy security; Failure (mechanical); Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lithium-ion batteries; Transition metal oxides; Transition metals; Battery technology; Characterization techniques; Electrochemical performance; Failure mechanism; Future research directions; Liquid electrolytes; Research and development; Technical barriers; detection method; electric vehicle; equipment; failure mechanism; greenhouse gas; research and development; Charging (batteries)","US Department of Energy; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; Vehicle Technologies Office, VTO","This work was supported by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Vehicle Technologies of the US Department of Energy under the eXtreme Fast Charge Cell Evaluation of Li-ion batteries (XCEL) programme.","Y.

Within the dynamic field of EVs, this paper highlights strategic directions for policy makers to increase EV uptake. The paper critically reviews measures adopted by some industrialised countries to motivate consumer purchase of EVs rather than conventional internal combustion vehicles (ICVs). A key focus is the role of financial and soft incentives to encourage EV adoption. The analysis reveals that not all incentives are equally effective; an adequate recharger network appears to be a common concerning factor for EV adoption due to customer anxiety and vehicle limitations. Best practice strategies that could foster a faster transition to EV adoption include appropriate legislation, installation and maintenance of an adequate public recharger network, government procurement programs, and investment in information programs to accelerate the transition towards fossil free driving. The paper evidences how implementation of these strategies can affect overall adoption rates. © 2017 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","Europe; United States; best management practice; electric vehicle; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; policy making; technology adoption; transportation economics","","","G.H.

To analyse the optimal functioning power of policies and determine the direction of future policy implementation, this paper utilizes the COPA framework (i.e., analysis from four dimensions of contents, outlook, power, and authorities) to analyse policy evolution in respect of the new-energy vehicle industry (NEVI). In addition, a quantitative table of policy power is designed to construct the policy effects in various periods. Furthermore, this paper employs threshold model and quantile regression model to explore the threshold effect of policy power on the policy implementation effects and the transformation of policy implementation effects at different development stages, respectively. The results are as follows. (1) The Chinese NEVI policy continues to attach importance to government-guided consumption and government-supported technical development, with the major issuing form still being “notices”. Although “moderate” industrial policies are adopted as the main policies, the issuance strength has been rising periodically, and the functioning strength has been maintaining a steady rise year by year. The non-definition of the competent authorities is one of the key factors that affect the development of the NEVI. (2) The policy power has a significant threshold effect on its functioning strength. When the policy strength exceeds the threshold value of 69, the effect of the policy will nearly double; thus, to promote the technological innovation of NEVs, it is necessary to formulate high-intensity policies. (3) The effect of industrial policy will differ greatly at different development stages. Along with the gradual formation of market orientation of the NEVI, the effect of industrial policies has weakened gradually. Properly reducing the subsidy of NEVs will achieve the optimal allocation of government resources. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","New-energy vehicle industry; Policy effect; Policy evolution","China; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Regression analysis; Competent authorities; Environmental pollutions; New energy vehicles; Policy effects; Policy evolution; Policy implementations; Technical development; Technological innovation; conceptual framework; future prospect; industrial policy; innovation; policy implementation; technological development; Public policy","Jiangsu Education Science Project, (B-b/2015/01/027); Key Project of Postgraduate Education and Teaching Reform in Jiangsu Province, (JGZZ18_047); Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of China University of Mining and Technology; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, (KYCX19_2148); Jiangsu Office of Philosophy and Social Science, (17JDB004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71974188); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (19JDGC011)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71974188 ), Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (Grant NO.

For the experimental analysis carried out in this study, three different electric vehicles from the Edinburgh College leasing program were equipped and tracked to obtain over 50 GPS and energy consumption data for short distance journeys in the Edinburgh area and long-range tests between Edinburgh and Bristol (UK). The results showed that the vehicles' energy intensities were significantly affected by the driving cycle pattern, with a noticeable diminution due to low temperatures. It was found that the real available range of the electric vehicle in some situations could be 17% lower than the predicted mileage shown in the dashboard of the vehicle.

The government is facing severe problems from energy security, carbon emissions and environmental issues. The past trends and future plans of energy will have great influence on the transportation, construction and industry development. This paper summarizes the present and future energy structure in China. Conventional fossil energy, nuclear energy and renewable energy are all included. Electricity will account for more proportion in total energy consumption in the future, and the structure of electricity will be cleaner. That will promote the development of electric vehicles and the transformation of China's automotive industry. The optimization of energy structure will accelerate the low-carbon development in China. China's energy development will enter a new stage from the expansion of total quantity to the upgrading of quality and efficiency. In order to realize the Paris Climate Agreement, China must steadily control the total energy consumption. The energy consumption in China will be in a period of slow growth. Constantly optimizing the energy structure and promoting renewable energy will both ease the energy crisis and ensure that China's goal of reducing CO2 emissions can be achieved. China will further strengthen international cooperation in energy projects in the future. Through the cooperation, the energy structure in China will be further optimized. The efficient technology research & development and infrastructure construction of energy storage and remote power transfer will be vital to energy development. It will have influence on the future promotion of various renewable energy resources.

Allowing for gate fees the incentive required for financial viability was 0.13 €/m                             3                              (13 €/MWh). For context, various successful renewable energy policies were analysed across the EU including photovoltaics and biogas in Germany and electric vehicles in Norway. The schemes were compared with an incentive applied (or required) per tCO                             2                              avoided. For Ireland, this study predicts that biomethane needs a financial subsidy of less than 180 €/tCO                             2                              avoided, while most successful EU systems offer incentivisation levels less than 260 €/tCO                             2                              avoided. In terms of incentives per tCO                             2                              avoided Electric Vehicles (EV) stand out. When including all incentives such as grants and avoided parking costs, EVs can receive a sixteen-fold higher incentive as compared to biomethane based on tCO                             2                              emissions avoided. The rationale for this high incentive and supporting policy is based on the requirement to initiate a new infrastructure that would not otherwise happen without intervention of a government incentivising decarbonised transport and clean air. Biomethane as a transport fuel requires a very significant change in infrastructure, including the provision of compressed natural gas service stations and natural gas vehicles. Initially (as for other successful renewable energy systems) larger incentives would be required to allow initiation of the industry, but these subsidies can be reduced over time. Biomethane as a transport fuel offers similar rewards as for electric vehicles, decarbonised transport and clean air along with energy security, renewable energy, indigenous jobs and supporting greening of agriculture.                          © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Biomethane;                              CO                             <sub>2</sub>                              emissions                         ; Energy policy; Renewable heat incentive","Compressed natural gas; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Energy security; Gas industry; Renewable energy resources; Bio-energy; Biomethane; CO2 emissions; Financial viability; Renewable energy policy; Renewable energy systems; Renewable heat; Supporting policies; Natural gas vehicles","Environmental Protection Agency, Ireland; Gas Networks Ireland; MaREI Centre, (12/RC/2302, 16/SP/3829); Environmental Protection Agency, (2016-RE-DS-6); Science Foundation Ireland","The Environmental Protection Agency, Ireland ( EPA, 2016-RE-DS-6 ) with co-funding from Gas Networks Ireland funded this work with additional funding from the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) MaREI Centre (Grant no. 12/RC/2302 and 16/SP/3829 ).

Methods: This study chose the double species model to predict electric vehicles’ growth trajectory under mutually competitive conditions between electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles. For comparison, it set two scenarios: with 200 and 300 vehicles per thousand persons at 2050. To give details on energy saving and carbon dioxide mitigation potential induced by electric vehicles’ market penetration, it further divided electric vehicles into five subgroups and internal combustion engine vehicles into seven subgroups, therein forming respective measurement formulas. Results: This paper solved the double species model and thus got its analytical formula. Then it employed the analytical formula to conduct an empirical study on electric vehicles market penetration in China from year 2010 to 2050. Under scenario 300, electric vehicles growth trajectory will emerge a quick growth stage during 2021–2035, thereafter keeping near invariant till 2050. Meanwhile, current internal combustion engine vehicles’ quick growth will continue up to 2027, then holding constant during 2028–2040, afterwards following a 10-year slowdown period. Scenario 200 has similar features, but a 2-year delay for electric vehicles and a 5-year lead time for internal combustion engine vehicles were found. On average, scenario 300 will save 114.4 Mt oil and 111.5 Mt carbon dioxide emissions, and scenario 200 will save 77.1 Mt oil and 73.4 Mt carbon dioxide emissions each year. Beyond 2032, annual 50.0% of road transport consumed oil and 18.6% of carbon dioxide emissions from this sector will be saved under scenario 300. Discussion: Compared with scenario 200, scenario 300 was more suitable to predict electric vehicle market penetration in China. In the short-term electric vehicle penetration only brings about trivial effects, while in the long-term it will contribute a lot to both energy security and carbon dioxide mitigation. The contribution of this article provided a more suitable methodology for predicting electric vehicle market penetration, simulated two coupled trajectories of electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles, and discussed relative energy-saving and climate effects from 2010 to 2050. © The Author(s) 2021.","carbon dioxide mitigation; conjoint analysis; Double species model; electric vehicle’s growth trajectory; internal combustion engine vehicles’ growth trajectory; oil saving","","Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences, CUAS, (R2012JG04); Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, CQMEC, (21SKGH227); Natural Science Foundation Project of Chongqing, Chongqing Science and Technology Commission, (cstc2012jjA20013)","This research was funded by Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC (No. cstc2012jjA20013), Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences Project (No. R2012JG04) and 2021 Humanities and Social Sciences Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (No. 21SKGH227).

Yet, mainly due to their high costs, especially in the case of pure battery electric vehicles, and a lack of proper infrastructure, the use of EVs is still very limited. In this paper, some of the major barriers and the future challenges are discussed. The current problems are mainly attributed to two categories: (1) the battery performances and costs, as well as battery production including issue of material availability and (2) environmental benefits of EVs depending on the sources used for the electricity generation and their carbon intensity. The major conclusions are that (1) research and development with respect to batteries has by far the highest priority and (2) it has to be ensured that the electricity used in EVs is generated largely from renewable energy sources. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Battery; Costs; Emissions; Lithium","alternative energy; atmospheric pollution; cost analysis; electric vehicle; electricity; electricity generation; emission; energy resource; equipment; lithium; performance assessment; research and development","","","A.

The analysis is carried out using multi-level dynamic MFA model and 9 scenarios investigating EVs and batteries market share, their materials content and lifetime, and materials recycling. EVs materials impacts on coproduced materials, and energy, water, and CO2 emissions associated with materials production are discussed. Global metals availability is not expected to constraint EVs development in China, while several metals availability in China is expected to limit their growth. Significant increase in most metals production capacity is required. Extending EVs lifetime and using more than one battery reduce risks associated with REEs and increase those associated with other metals. Metals stock in use is expected to be significant compared to current Chinese reserves. EVs development in China has significant implications on resources availability, mainly REEs and graphite, for other world regions and other sectors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; Critical materials; Dynamic MFA; Electric vehicles; Scenario analysis","China; Climate change; Competition; Electronic Waste; Energy security; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Metals; Secondary batteries; CO2 emissions; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Long term analysis; Materials production; Materials recycling; Pollution problems; Production capacity; Transportation sector; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electric vehicle; electrification; energy market; energy planning; energy storage; environmental impact assessment; global perspective; long-term change; rare earth element; scenario analysis; Metal analysis","Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDA19040102); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (131A11KYSB20170117, 2016YFA0602802)","This research is funded by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [Grant Number XDA19040102 ]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [Grant Number 2016YFA0602802 ]; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [Grant Number 131A11KYSB20170117 ].

Benefiting from policy dividend, the global threshold of 1 million electric cars on the road had been exceeded in 2015, closing at 1.26 million. Among these incentive policies, subsidy scheme was regarded as the most important and effective. However, many governments intend to abrogate subsidy for electric vehicle, such as China, America and Germany. It`s worth finding out the key factors including incentive measures and additional socio-economic factors that promote electric vehicle adoption. Utilizing multiple linear regression method, we explore the relationship between those variables and 30 national electric vehicle market shares for the year 2015. The results show that chargers` density, fuel price and road priority are significantly positive factors correlated with a country`s electric vehicle market share. Nevertheless, fiscal incentives are no longer the reasons for the huge differences of electric vehicle promotion over countries.

In the management and utilization of electricity, the development of renewable energy (RE) power generation in Indonesia is carried out while taking into account the balance with other aspects, namely Energy Security, Energy Equity, and Energy Sustainability or called as Energy Trilemma. In accordance with PLN's Electricity Supply and Demand Business Plan (RUPTL) 2018-2027 that has been approved by the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, the total capacity of RE power generation to be built up to 2025 is about of 14.3 GW consists of geothermal power generation (PLTP) of 4.6 GW; hydro power generation (including mini-hydro and pump storage): 7.7 GW; solar power generation (PLTS): 1.0 GW; wind power generation (PLTB): 0.6 GW; and biomass/waste power generation (PLTBm/PLTSa): 0.4 GW. The RE power generation to be developed is still dominated by «Non-Intermittent» RE power generation (89%). While the «Intermittent» RE power generation that will be developed is still relatively small, which is only about 11%. This is due to challenges in its development, namely PLN is the only «Off-Taker» in the electricity business, and not all RE power generation can be accepted by the electricity system. As an effort to improve the development of RE power generation, the policy actions that have been or will be implemented by the government are 1) Development of RE power generation should be consider the balancing between «supply and demand» and the readiness of the electricity system to tapping the RE power generation at the most competitive costs; 2) Development of Distributed Generation or Micro-Grid; 3) Revision of the Grid Code to accommodate the Intermittent RE power generator; 4) Development of Smart-Grid; and 5) Acceleration of the Electric Vehicle Program. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.","","Competition; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Energy security; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Geothermal energy; Greenhouse gases; Mineral resources; Planning; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Wind power; Electricity business; Electricity supply and demands; Energy sustainability; Geothermal power generation; Hydro-power generation; International assistance; Management and utilization; Renewable power generation; Smart power grids","","","C.

It finds that environmental and energy security pressures have created a favourable landscape ‘push’ for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) that in turn has encouraged and facilitated serious commitment from some manufacturers. Yet BEVs, as a niche product seeking to disrupt an entrenched and established regime, face significant multi-level forces acting as barriers against such a transition, which the paper explores. This combination of factors creates a situation where BEV market penetration remains far below the level required for mass market transition. For BEVs to ‘cross the chasm’ and gain an established foothold in the market and hence significantly disrupt the regime, more holistic and effective solutions are required.

With the current heterogeneity of grid electricity mix in China, greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) vary dramatically with location. Currently, compared to baseline conventional gasoline vehicles, BEVs in north and northeastern Chinese provinces have very modest (∼10-20%) well-to-wheel (WTW) GHG benefits, whereas BEVs in southern provinces have substantial benefits (∼50%). With the expected transition to a more renewable electricity mix documented here, regional effects will largely disappear and the benefits of BEVs will be substantial (∼60-70% lower than current internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and ∼10-40% lower than 2030 advanced hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs)) across the whole of China by 2030. GHG emissions from BEVs in Chinese cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Pearl River Delta) and United States cities and regions (New York; Washington, DC; Chicago; New England; Texas; and California) in 2015 and 2030 are evaluated and compared. BEVs in Chinese cities will still have substantially higher WTW GHG emissions than those in New York, New England, and California in 2030. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","","Beijing; California; Chicago; China; Cities; Electricity; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Motor Vehicles; New England; New York; Texas; United States; Vehicle Emissions; China; United States; Battery electric vehicles; Energy security; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; Vehicle-to-grid; Conventional gasoline; Electricity generation greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); Internal combustion engine vehicles; Pearl River delta; Regional effects; Renewable electricity; combustion; electric vehicle; electricity generation; electrification; emission; greenhouse gas; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; California; China; city; electricity; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; Illinois; motor vehicle; New York; Texas; United States; Hybrid vehicles","","","W.

The novelty of the mechanism as a kind of model predictive control (MPC) is that it seeks an effective way of managing electric energy in an Electric Vehicle (EV). Additionally, it proposes a new method of predicting the electricity consumption which allows the battery of an electric vehicle to reconcile two sides: both the system's and the user's demand will be met at the same time. The model allows for very precise determination of the vehicle's demand for the energy related to the progressive movement, taking into account the parameters characteristic of a given vehicle model, its suspension structure and aerodynamics. In addition, the machine learning algorithm was proposed for the prediction model as a hybrid (offline and online) of supervised learning. As the first part of the research, by using Matlab/Simulink/dSpace software, a prediction of EV energy consumption was created on a selected route at different times of the day (offline data matrix). At the same time, the simulated route was travelled by a BMW i3 EV (online data matrix). Based on the developed machine learning algorithm the results of the electric energy consumption were compared. The research confirms that if the correct mechanism for prediction of energy consumption by the EV is used, it is possible to define the amount of energy needed for a V2G service. The measurement error was obtained at 0.5%. The added value is setting up the EV energy security of customers after the V2G service and a correct WIN-WIN relation between the Low Voltage grid and EV customers' needs. © 2013 IEEE.","electric vehicle; machine learning; MPC; V2G","Charging (batteries); Energy security; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Machine learning; MATLAB; Matrix algebra; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicles; Electric energies; Electric energy consumption; Electricity-consumption; Parameters characteristics; Precise determinations; Prediction model; Predictive modeling; Suspension structure; Learning algorithms","","","B.

The transformation is mainly characterized by the adoption of biofuel blends and hybrid electric vehicles, as well as niche technologies. For the emergence of an ideal low carbon road system in the UK, it is shown that the transformation pathway is insufficient and the likely pathway sequence to full decarbonization will be transformation-substitution-de-alignment/re-alignment.

Nowadays, it is widely accepted that integrating vRESs is highly needed to solve a multitude of global concerns such as meeting an increasing demand for electricity, enhancing energy security, reducing heavy dependence on fossil fuels for energy production and the overall carbon footprint of power production. As a result, the scale of vRES development has been steadily increasing in many electric distribution networks. The favorable agreements of states to curb greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change, along with other technical, socio-economic and structural factors, is expected to further accelerate the integration of renewables in electric distribution networks. Many states are now embarking on ambitious “clean” energy development targets. Distributed generations (DGs) are especially attracting a lot of attention nowadays, and planners and policy makers seem to favor more on a distributed power generation to meet the increasing demand for electricity in the future. And, the role of traditionally centralized power production regime is expected to slowly diminish in future grids. This means that existing electric distribution networks should be readied to effectively handle the increasing penetration of DGs, vRESs in particular, because such systems are not principally designed for this purpose. It is because of all this that regulators often set a maximum RES penetration limit (often in the order of 20%) which is one of the main factors that impede further development of the much-needed vRESs. The main challenge is posed by the high-level variability as well as partial unpredictability of vRESs which, along with traditional sources of uncertainty, leads to several technical problems and increases operational risk in the system. This is further exacerbated by the increased uncertainty posed by the continuously changing and new forms of energy consumption such as power-to-X and electric vehicles. All these make operation and planning of distribution networks more intricate. Therefore, there is a growing need to transform existing systems so that they are equipped with adequate flexibility mechanisms (options) that are capable of alleviating the aforementioned challenges and effectively managing inherent technical risk. To this end, the main focus of this chapter is on the optimal management of distribution networks featuring such flexibility options and vRESs. This analysis is supported by numerical results from a standard network system. For this, a reasonably accurate mathematical optimization model is developed, which is based on a linearized AC network model. The results and analysis in this book chapter have policy implications that are important to optimally design ad operate future grids, featuring large-scale variable energy resources. In general, based on the analysis results, distribution networks can go 100% renewable if various flexibility options are adequately deployed and operated in a more efficient manner. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Demand response; Electric distribution networks; Energy storage systems; Flexibility options; Mixed integer linear programming; Network reconfiguration; Stochastic programing; Variable renewable energy sources","","","","D.Z.

While India is making significant progress in the first three, we hardly see any electric vehicles on our roads, though the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP-2020) was launched by the Government of India on 9 January 2013 with the aspiration of selling 6-7 million new electric vehicles in 2020 to achieve liquid fuel savings of 2.2-2.5 million tonnes, along with substantial lowering of vehicular emissions and a decrease in CO2 emissions. In addition to these vital benefits, acceleration of electric mobility in India will also lead to higher job creation in manufacturing. In this article, key recommendations are proposed to accelerate the progress of electric vehicles as a much-needed move towards a more sustainable and energy-secure future for India and a healthier life for Indians. ©. 2018, Current Science Association, Bengaluru.

The determinants include economic (GDP), socio-economic (household income), energy (electricity use), and environmental (СО2 emissions) factors. The authors justify the role of electric transport in strengthening national energy security due to the transition to renewable energy technologies and the reduction of fossil fuel use. Based on the constructed linear regression equations, a weak relationship has been revealed between the number of electric vehicles sold and the environmental factor, which can be explained by the small share of electric cars in the US market. The formed multifactor linear model showed a positive impact of both the country-s GDP growth and electricity consumption increase on the number of electric vehicles sold. However, the rise in household incomes negatively influences market development due to insufficient consumer awareness of the electric transport operation benefits, an underdeveloped network of electric vehicle charging stations, etc. Based on the obtained multifactor model, the authors have built optimistic, optimal and pessimistic scenarios for the US electric vehicle market deployment for the next five years. In order to implement the most favorable scenarios, recommendations for market development factors- management have been made. The results of the study can be used to improve public policy in the US transport and energy sectors, as well as in other countries to optimize the fuel and energy balance, strengthen the energy independence of states by developing clean transport and adapting the model to national specifics. © 2020.

Online monitoring of battery parameters namely capacity and impedance are crucial to get better performance and life from the system. Impedance is a complex parameter comprises of ohmic, charge transfer and diffusion components. The effective impedance value differs depending on the measurement methodology and data accusation speed. DC method is generally used in the field due to simplicity and cost effectiveness. The present study adopts DC current interruption method for measuring impedance of 12.8 V/10 Ah, LFP/C battery. The voltage recovery and relaxation segment were used to derive impedance value at various SoC’s. First using electrochemical theory, it was proved that only diffusion is operating after current interruption when data is monitored at 1 s interval. The diffusion resistance changes not only with SoC but also with mode of operation i.e., charge vs. discharge. An empirical model was proposed taking care of three forces namely voltage gradient, repulsive force between lithium atom in graphene layer and Van der Waal’s force between graphene layers. The impact of the diffusion resistance on BMS is highlighted. It is suggested that the study can be used for monitoring ageing and calendaring life of battery, deducing the relationship between raw material and design parameter to performance of the battery. © 2021 The Electrochemical Society (“ECS”).

To achieve simultaneous growth of the global sale and market share of NEV and alleviate the energy shortage, the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) framework is applied in this study to analyze the influence factors and the resistance and motivation of marketing of NEV. MLP is a comprehensive analytical framework used for the research on technological transformation of the automotive industry. It can simultaneously focus on the impact of the main factors, namely, landscapes, regimes, and niches, on the marketing of NEV in China. The results show that regimes form a certain “blocking” for the marketing of NEV, and the “blocking” greatly suppresses the growth of the market share. Landscapes and niches have a considerable effect on the promotion of the NEV market and breakthrough of the traditional industry's “blocking”. To further promote the marketing of NEV and alleviate the energy shortage, application policies should be made with notice of regional disequilibrium to improve the market competitiveness of NEV and ensure synchronous and sustainable growth of sales and market share. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Energy shortage; Multi-Level Perspective; New energy vehicles; Sustainable development","Automotive industry; Competition; Electric vehicles; Energy conservation; Energy security; Marketing; Motivation; Planning; Sustainable development; Energy development; Energy shortages; Global sales; Market share; New energy vehicles; Simultaneous growth; Sustainable growth; Traditional industry; Commerce","","","","","Elsevier Inc.","22105379","","","","English","Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086735066"

Today it is the 6th largest and one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Rising income level, increased consumerism, rapid growth in urbanization and digitization have attributed to this change. Government focus on ""Make in India"" for promoting trade and investment in India have ensured that India emerge as one of the largest growing economies in the world. The automotive industry played a pivotal role in the manufacturing sector to boost economic activities in India. The passenger car market has increased 3 times over the last decade and it has led to increased mobility options for many people across India. However, this has put concerns on the country's energy security and emission levels. According to IEA's recent report on global CO2 emission, 32.31 Gt of CO2 emissions were from fuel combustion in 2016, out of which transport sector contributed ~25%. India contributed ~11% of transport emissions in Asia in 2016. This necessitates systematic approach and action plans to curb India's vehicular CO2 emissions. In line with this, Government of India has already implemented different regulations, policies (e.g. CAFÉ, BSVI) and has also notified future action plans (e.g. RDE, electrification, etc.). Globally, CAFÉ norms have been adopted by many countries (e.g. USA, EU, South Korea, etc.) to reduce their carbon footprint by reducing CO2 emissions and petroleum consumption. Its implementation has accelerated since 2010 and globally governments are imposing stricter targets. India on the other hand has its own unique challenges like large population (1.3 Bn.), high cost sensitivity, unorganized urbanization and average lower income. India need its own unique sustainable and affordable mobility approach (CNG, HEVs, EVs, Biofuels, etc.) and at the same time strike a balance between automotive industry growth, environmental impacts and employment opportunities to address these concerns. This paper aims to provide systematic approach for CO2 emission reduction in the automotive sector. © 2019 SAE International.

However, if charging is not appropriately controlled, massive EV penetration can lead to significant challenges for local distribution systems. In this context, this paper presents a new extensive tool, based on a Matlab/Simulink platform, to model distribution networks and analyse the impacts of charging of EVs, generation from local Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and the use of smart grid technologies to mitigate these impacts. The tool models the geographical locations of the distribution substations and the nodes where local loads, RES and EV charges may be connected. It allows the user to study the operational framework of current and future distribution networks and enables techno-economic assessment to be made. The modelling tool simulates the daily basis operation of any low-voltage (LV) distribution grid, considering the interaction with both consumers and local RES. This is done by evaluating key system performance measures, such as nodal voltages, line currents and transformer overloading. A user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) facilitates the flexible management of the input parameters. The tool was applied to analyse an existing UK LV distribution network, to demonstrate the feasibility of smart charging and V2G (Vehicle to Grid) technology and the advantages over uncontrolled charging. This paper presents the outline of the modelling tool and the results of investigation of the different scenarios considered in this research. © 2018 IEEE.","distribution network; Electric vehicles; renewable energy; smart charging; smart grid; vehicle to grid","Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Energy security; Geographical distribution; Graphical user interfaces; Internal combustion engines; Renewable energy resources; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicles; Voltage distribution measurement; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Local distribution system; Low-voltage distributions; LV distribution networks; Renewable energies; Smart charging; Smart grid; Techno-economic assessment; Electric power transmission networks","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-153862910-9","","","English","Proc. - Int.

Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets offer the strongest magnetic field per volume among all the magnets available in the market, which enables lightweight and compact product designs. NdFeB magnets have thus become indispensable in emerging clean technologies such as wind turbines and electric vehicles (EVs). Global demand for these renewables is increasing due to environmental considerations, energy security, and consumer demand. However, China's dominance in REE production and processing technology has led to concerns pertaining to supply chain risks. This is especially the case for the automotive industry that is experiencing a major shift from traditional internal combustion engines to EVs that employ these REPMs. The number of EVs on U.S. roads is projected to reach more than 18 million in 2030 up from 1.4 million in 2019. In order to mitigate supply chain brittleness, and thereby potentially reduce price volatility, secondary REE supply sources from end-of-life (EoL) products may be a viable option. This study quantifies the recycling potential of Nd and Dy from EoL EVs, HDDs and MRIs in the U.S. Factors used in the analysis were number of units manufactured each year, NdFeB magnet mass in each unit and REE composition of magnets employed. Using EV production forecasts, we estimate how much of the future Nd and Dy demands can be met by secondary supply from EoL products. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

The societal benefits of large-scale adoption of EVs cannot be realized without adequate deployment of publicly accessible charging stations. We propose a two-stage stochastic programming model to determine the optimal network of charging stations for a community, considering uncertainties in the arrival and dwell times of vehicles, the state of charge of arriving vehicles' batteries, drivers' walking ranges and charging preferences, demand during weekdays and weekends, and the community's rate of EV adoption. We conducted studies using the sample average approximation method, which asymptotically converges to an optimal solution for a two-stage stochastic problem. However, this method is computationally expensive for large-scale instances. Therefore, we also developed a heuristic to produce nearly optimal solutions quickly for our data instances. We conducted computational experiments using various publicly available data sources and evaluated the benefits of the solutions for a given community, both quantitatively and qualitatively. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","charging network; electric vehicle; sample average approximation; Two-stage stochastic programming","Electric vehicles; Energy security; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Mathematical programming; Optimal systems; Random processes; Solar cells; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Sample average approximation; Two-stage stochastic programming; Uncertainty; Charging (batteries)","Transportation Research Center for Livable Communities at Western Michigan University; U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT","Manuscript received January 9, 2017; revised November 5, 2017 and February 15, 2018; accepted May 18, 2018.

However, where some nations have shown a clear path towards rising EV uptake during the past decade, Australia has steadfastly refused to follow: EV uptake has been extremely limited, while established patterns of liquid fuel consumption have continued unabated. The potential virtues of EV adoption have been extolled from all the usual perspectives: environmental benefits have been measured, low economic running costs have been highlighted, and even improved levels of energy security have been indicated. But these arguments to encourage EV uptake have failed to gain any traction sufficient to replace the status quo of a national road transport system that has grown to rely on a diet of imported conventional liquid fuels. A recent survey of industry, research and government operatives by Murdoch University researchers probed public awareness of the complex issues surrounding transport fuel economics and the reasons for consumer reluctance to change to EVs. The main aim of this paper is to use information from the survey as evidence to support the theory that the path to improving EV uptake in Australia will continue to fail unless EVs become available under a certain set of conditions, or possibly until it happens by default when The Fourth Wave arrives. © 2019 Australasian Transport Research Forum, ATRF 2019 - Proceedings.

However, along with the socio-economic development, the rapid increase in the number of means of transport and the increasing demand for energy has made human society face great challenges, including the depletion of fossil fuel resources, the threat to energy security, climate change, the rapid increase in environmental pollution and CO2 emission. In this situation, the use of the electric vehicle has been put into consideration and developed in many advanced countries around the world. However, a question is raised whether the demand, infrastructure and policies to support the use of electric vehicles in developing countries, such as Vietnam, are attractive to investors and users and which roadmap for electric vehicles is suitable for Vietnam. In this paper, the prospects for the development of the electric vehicle market in Vietnam have been carefully analyzed for a long-term strategic vision. The roadmap for the use of electric vehicles in Vietnam is illustrated to encourage people to use electric vehicles, to recommend the government to issue reasonable policies, and to attract investors in the field of electric vehicles. In short, the expansion and development of electric vehicles in Vietnam need a long term and specific plan, part of which should be the cooperation of both the community and government in reducing the environmental pollution. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Electric vehicles; environmental pollution; infrastructure; socio-economic efficiency; Vietnamese policy","Climate change; Developing countries; Economics; Energy security; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Pollution; CO2 emissions; Driving forces; Environmental pollutions; Fossil fuel resources; Human society; Socio-economic development; Strategic orientation; Strategic vision; Vehicles","","","A.T.

Hydrogen can be integrated in multiple energy sectors and has the potential to increase overall energy system flexibility, improve energy security, and reduce environmental impact. In this paper, the interactions between fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), hydrogen production facilities, and the electric power grid are explored. The flexibility of hydrogen production systems can create synergistic opportunities to better integrate renewable sources into the electricity system. To quantify this potential, we project the hourly system-wide balancing challenges in California out to 2025 as more renewables are deployed and electricity demand continues to grow. Passenger FCEV adoption and refueling behavior are modeled in detail to spatially and temporally resolve the hydrogen demand. We then quantify the system-wide balancing benefits of controlling hydrogen production from water electrolysis to mitigate renewable intermittency, without compromising the mobility needs of FCEV drivers. Finally, a control algorithm that can achieve different objectives, including peak shaving, valley filling, and ramping mitigation is proposed. Our results show that oversizing electrolyzers can provide considerable benefits to mitigate renewable intermittency, while also supporting the deployment of hydrogen vehicles to help decarbonize the transportation sector. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Duck curve; Electric power system; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Grid integration; Hydrogen; Renewable energy","Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Energy security; Environmental impact; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Renewable energy resources; Vehicles; Duck curve; Electricity production; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Grid integration; Hydrogen production systems; Renewable energies; Renewable energy integrations; Transportation sector; Hydrogen production","DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Office; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC02- 05CH11231); National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL, (DE-AC36-08GO28308); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, LBNL","This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02- 05CH11231 with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308 with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory .

Moreover, many countries are encouraging the growth of EVs to reduce carbon and other green house gas emission, limit air and noise pollution, and enhance energy security. However, in the design of traditional power systems, these technological advancements were not considered. These technologies can make an impact on the life of assets of the distribution systems. Therefore, they need to be addressed appropriately for better estimation of asset utilization. A DT is one of the major assets for any electrical distribution system.

With economic development, travel demands and logistics demands will continue to rise in China. To solve the associated problems, policies related to electric vehicle (EV) promotion and fuel economy regulations are being adopted by the state government. Six scenarios, based on different policies, are analyzed to calculate vehicle fleet GHG emissions in this research by developing a bottom-up modeling framework from a life-cycle perspective. When only fuel economy regulations are considered, GHG emissions from the road transport sector will reach their peak in 2047. However, combined with EV deployment, the peak will arrive earlier, in 2026. In the short term, more stringent fuel economy regulations exhibit better results. Without EVs, fuel economy regulations will be tougher for corporations to meet than with the introduction of EVs. However, in the long term, with a higher proportion of EVs, GHG emissions will further decrease. In addition, the introduction of EVs will weaken the effects of fuel economy regulations, especially for passenger vehicles, due to credit policies. The lack of EVs in the commercial vehicle fleet will impart more significance to the fuel economy regulations. Commercial vehicles, particularly trucks, will account for the majority of GHG emissions by the whole vehicle fleet. In brief, the government should persistently focus on the fuel economy regulations to achieve an early and relatively low-level peak in vehicle fleet GHG emissions. Meanwhile, the promotion of EVs will have the long-term effect of de-carbonization. In addition, more effective measures should be taken to reduce the truck GHG emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; Corporate average fuel consumption; Electric vehicle; Greenhouse gas","Carbonization; Commercial vehicles; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Energy utilization; Fleet operations; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Roads and streets; Trucks; China; Economic development; Effective measures; Environmental issues; Life cycle perspectives; Passenger vehicles; Road transport sectors; Vehicle electrifications; Fuel economy","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71403142, 71690241, 71774100); China Academy of Space Technology, CAST, (YESS20160140)","This study is sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 71774100 , 71403142 , 71690241 ), Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST ( YESS20160140 ).

Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are creating new connections between the transportation and electric sectors, and PEV charging will create opportunities and challenges in a system of growing complexity. Here, I use highly resolved models of residential power demand and PEV use to assess the impact of uncoordinated in-home PEV charging on residential power demand. While the increase in aggregate demand might be minimal even for high levels of PEV adoption, uncoordinated PEV charging could significantly change the shape of the aggregate residential demand, with impacts for electricity infrastructure, even at low adoption levels. Clustering effects in vehicle adoption at the local level might lead to high PEV concentrations even if overall adoption remains low, significantly increasing peak demand and requiring upgrades to the electricity distribution infrastructure. This effect is exacerbated when adopting higher in-home power charging. © 2018 The Author(s).","","Aggregates; Air quality; Carbon; Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Housing; Vehicles; Adoption level; Aggregate demands; Carbon emissions; Clustering effect; Electricity distribution; Electricity infrastructure; Plug-in electric vehicle charging; Residential power demand; air quality; demand analysis; electric vehicle; electricity; electricity industry; electrification; energy budget; residential energy; technology adoption; Plug-in electric vehicles","US Department of Energy; National Science Foundation, (1029337)","The author would like to thank G.

India’s future energy security is threatened by increasing oil prices and high import costs. The availability of charging power and charging infrastructure is one of the key reasons for the widespread adoption of EVs. Considering that up to 50% of vehicles are charged from supply mains, the amount of power required was analysed. Whether the Indian power grid is sufficiently capable of delivering the required charging power and fulfilling the Indian government’s goal of increasing the use of EVs requires investigation. Energy losses were measured in 255 villages in Gujarat, India, and solutions were suggested as well as implemented to overcome these losses. The experimental test setup of a centrifugal pump was developed and implemented in villages and industry by using variable frequency drive, programmable logic controllers, and a supervisory control and data acquisition system with a cost-effective paddle-wheel flow meter. Similar energy-efficiency improvement scopes were determined and implemented in all the villages under study.

At present, the large-scale access of EVs will aggravate the load peak-valley difference and make the load power fluctuate greatly, which brings challenges to the stability of the power grid. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively predict the charging demand distribution. In this paper, we propose data-driven mobility on charging demand modeling. Considering the travel time and travel location, we first establish the historical travel rule utilizing the data mining and clustering method. After that, the travel route model is designed to determine the shortest the travel distance. Besides, the charging demand model with different driving characteristics of vehicles is provided to simulate the charging behavior. Finally, a case study with multiple date type scenarios is provided to verify the validity of the proposed model based on the actual travel data from Didi data center. © 2020 IEEE.","charging demand modeling; data-driven mobility; Electric vehicle; travel rule","Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Energy security; Travel time; Charging demands; Clustering methods; Driving characteristics; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environment pollution; Model-based OPC; Travel distance; Travel routes; Data mining","State Grid Corporation of China, SGCC, (SGSDJY00GPJS1900179)","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work was supported by State Grid Corporation of China Project (SGSDJY00GPJS1900179).","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172814303-3","","","English","IEEE/IAS Ind.

The controller parameters are obtained through time domain analysis that includes satisfying the performance specifications in the form of desired overshoot and settling time. The effectiveness of this optimal solution based PID tuning is tested through comparative simulation results with the other conventional methods of PID tuning. The comparative study has been done to find the effective and the best possible result obtained for the closed-loop control of DC Motor in both time domain and frequency domain analysis.

The transportation sector contributes significantly to these issues. Sustainable transport involves the consideration of three dimensions-economic development, environmental preservation, and social development-and one of its aspects is the focus on the transition towards electric vehicles. The sustainable transportation is a complex system with multiple relationships and feedback between their elements. Understanding this complexity in an integrated and holistic manner is a challenge that must be addressed. To obtain insight into this complexity, we perform a systematic review of studies in which the demand and supply components of the passenger transportation sector were modelled in an integrated manner along with the dimensions of sustainability. All the reviewed previous studies had taken into consideration both the economic and environmental dimensions; however, only a few had also considered social development.

Possible alternative fuel options need to be assessed to realize their potential to alleviate environmental burdens before policy formulations. Western Australia (WA) is dominated by private cars, accounting for around 72% vehicles with 87% of those using imported gasoline, and resulting in approximately 14% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transport sector. There is an urgent need for WA to consider alternative transport fuels not only to reduce the environmental burden but also to avoid future energy security consequences. This study assesses the environmental life cycle assessment (ELCA) of transport fuel options suitable for WA. The study revealed that ethanol (E65), electric (EV) and plug-in electric vehicle (PHEV) options can decrease global warming potential (GWP) by 40%, 29% and 14%, respectively, when compared to gasoline. The EV and PHEV also performed better than gasoline in the fossil fuel depletion (FFD) and water consumption (WC) impact categories. Gasoline, however, demonstrated better environmental performance in all the impact categories compared to hydrogen and that was mainly due to the high electricity requirement during the production of hydrogen. The use of platinum in hydrogen fuel cells and carbon fibre in the hydrogen tank for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCV) and Li-ion battery for EVs are the most important sources of environmental impacts. The findings of the study would aid the energy planners and decision makers in carrying out a comparative environmental assessment of the locally-sourced alternative fuels for WA. © 2019 by the authors.","Alternative transport fuel; Environmental performance; Life cycle assessment; Passenger vehicle; Western Australia","Australia; Western Australia; Carbon fibers; Decision making; Energy security; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuel tanks; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Life cycle; Lithium-ion batteries; Plug-in electric vehicles; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Passenger vehicles; Transport fuel; Western Australia; alternative fuel; environmental impact assessment; global warming; life cycle analysis; security; transportation policy; Alternative fuels","BP Kwinana Refinery; CSBP Fertilizer; Dow Chemical Australia Ltd.; Nufarm Australia; Public Transport Authority of Western Australia; Syngenta Australia; Curtin University of Technology","The authors are grateful for the 'Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship' for Najmul Hoque's study at Curtin University, Australia.

A major issue impeding an even more widespread adoption of EVs is range anxiety, which is due to several factors including limited battery capacity, limited availability of battery charging stations, and long charging time compared to traditional gasoline vehicles. By analyzing our accessible real-world EV taxi system-wide datasets, we observe that current EV taxi drivers often suffer from unpredictable, long waiting times at charging stations, due to temporally and spatially unbalanced utilization among charging stations. This is mainly because current taxi fleet management system simply rely on taxi drivers to make charging decisions. In this paper, In this paper, we develop REC, a Real-time Ev Charging scheduling framework for EV taxi fleets, which informs each EV taxi driver at runtime when and where to charge the battery. REC is able to analytically guarantee predictable and tightly bounded waiting times for all EVs in the fleet and temporally/spatially balanced utilization among charging stations, if each driver follows the charging decision made by REC. Moreover, REC can further efficiently handle real-life issues, e.g., allowing a taxi driver to charge at its preferred charging station while still guaranteeing balanced charging station utilization.We have extensively evaluated REC using our accessible real-world EV taxi system-wide datasets. Experimental results show that REC is able to address the unpredictability and unbalancing issues existing in current EV taxi fleet systems, yielding predictable and tightly bounded waiting times, and equally important, temporally/spatially balanced charging station utilization. © 2017 IEEE.","Charging-Scheduling; Electric-Taxi-Fleets; predictability; Real-time-Scheduling; Suspending-task-model","Charging (batteries); Energy security; Interactive computer systems; Real time systems; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Taxicabs; Battery capacity; Charging station; Gasoline vehicle; predictability; Real - time scheduling; Scheduling frameworks; Task modeling; Taxi fleets; Fleet operations","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10528725","978-153861414-3","PRSYE","","English","Proc.

Moreover, the demand for jet fuel and diesel is projected to grow faster than the demand for gasoline in the future, and is likely to result in low-octane gasoline components becoming more readily available. Significant initiatives with varying motivations are taking place to develop the battery electric vehicle (BEV) and the fuel cell as alternatives to ICE vehicles, and to establish fuels such as biofuels and natural gas as alternatives to conventional liquid fuels. However, each of these alternatives starts from a very low base and faces significant barriers to fast and unrestrained growth; thus, transport—and particularly commercial transport—will continue to be largely powered by ICEs running on petroleum-based liquid fuels for decades to come. Hence, the sustainability of transport in terms of affordability, energy security, and impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air quality can only be ensured by improving ICEs. Indeed, ICEs will continue to improve while using current market fuels, through improvements in combustion, control, and after-treatment systems, assisted by partial electrification in the form of hybridization. However, there is even more scope for improvement through the development of fuel/engine systems that can additionally leverage benefits in fuels manufacture and use components that may be readily available. Gasoline compression ignition (GCI), which uses low-octane gasoline in a compression ignition engine, is one such example. GCI would enable diesel-like efficiencies while making it easier to control nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates at a lower cost compared with modern diesel engines. Octane on demand (OOD) also helps to ensure optimum use of available fuel anti-knock quality, and thus improves the overall efficiency of the system. © 2019 THE AUTHOR","Diesel; Gasoline; Internal combustion engines; Transport energy","Air quality; Automobile manufacture; Battery electric vehicles; Combustion; Diesel engines; Energy security; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; Liquids; Natural gas vehicles; Nitrogen oxides; Petroleum transportation; Compression ignition; Compression ignition engine; Demand for gasolines; Diesel; Internal combustion engines (ICEs); Petroleum-based liquids; Sustainable transport; Transport energy; Biofuels","","","","","Elsevier Ltd","20958099","","","","English","Engineering","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064484034"

The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the implications of a tax-induced EV transition in Iceland for GHG mitigation, energy security, and economic benefits. The analytical tools include a techno-economic simulation model of the integrated energy-transport system which is linked to an Icelandic macroeconomic general equilibrium model. The impact of a new tax reform proposal by the government is compared with the current vehicle tax policy. The government proposal scenario is also examined under further inducements for EVs incorporating a value added tax exemption and banning the sale of new petroleum fuel vehicles. All scenarios are examined under a wide range of future changes in petroleum fuel prices and EV cost reduction. The results indicate that the overall macroeconomic benefits will be negligible, but they are expected to be positive in the long term as road electrification is deepened. The results show that although the tax-induced technological solution aimed at encouraging the adoption of EVs will enable a deep GHG emissions reduction in the long term, it will not be enough to meet the short-term climate targets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate target; Economic benefit; Electric vehicles; GHG emissions; Simulation model; Vehicle tax","Iceland; Climate models; Cost reduction; Economics; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy security; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum prospecting; Taxation; Climate targets; Economic benefits; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy transport systems; General equilibrium models; GHG emission; Simulation model; Socio-economic development; alternative energy; computer simulation; economic development; electric vehicle; electrification; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; numerical model; transportation system; Economic and social effects","Iceland's Ministry of Industry and Innovation; Icelandic New Energy; Icelandic research council; Icelandic Centre for Research, RANNIS, (163464-051); Orkuveita Reykjavíkur; national energy company (Landsvirkjun), Iceland","The preparation of this paper has been supported by: i) Samorka, Iceland , ii) The Icelandic research council (RANNIS) through grant number 163464-051 , iii) The national energy company (Landsvirkjun), Iceland , iv) Reykjavik Energy , v) Iceland's Ministry of Industry and Innovation , vi) Icelandic New Energy , and vii) Landsnet, Iceland .","E.

Unlike power grid security, PEV cybersecurity is significantly underexplored. However, cyberattacks on PEVs may lead to disastrous situations such as out-of-service EVs via denial-of-charging (DoC) or battery pack damage via overcharging. In this article, we attempt to address this issue by exploring control-oriented approaches for PEV cybersecurity. Specifically, we focus on designing algorithms for detecting cyberattacks that can potentially affect PEV battery packs during charging. We discuss two algorithms: first, static detector that utilizes only measured variables, and, second, dynamic detector that utilizes the knowledge of system dynamics along with the measurements. Furthermore, we propose a filter-based design approach for the dynamic detector that considers a multiobjective criterion including stability, robustness, and attack sensitivity. We perform theoretical analysis and simulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms under DoC and overcharging attacks that indicate the superiority of dynamic detector in terms of attack detectability.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Battery pack; cyberattack; plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs); vehicle security","Battery Pack; Charging (batteries); Electric power system security; Electric power transmission networks; Energy security; Security of data; Analysis and simulation; Cyberattack detection; Design approaches; Dynamic detectors; Economic stability; Environmental benefits; Large-scale deployment; Power grid securities; Plug-in electric vehicles","","","S.

Thus modernization of the traditional grid system in order to overcome the major setbacks is the need of hour. Making use of advanced tools and development of various applications for evolution of conventional system is the major lead for smart grid. Demand responses, optimization of grid usage, reduction of affected users in case of a fault are some of the major contributors in the implementation of smart grid. The several features of smart grid include induction of the renewable energy, best utilization of system resources reducing costs, effective generation and demand balance, highest system reliability, consumer participation in energy management, onsite generation, use of electric vehicle reducing the harmful pollution, minimum down time, boost in energy security and quality power to users. It provides high quality and reliable energy supply to critical loads and provides easy integration with existing grid system. It provides support to the main grid in the form of export of real power and reactive power. Besides, the consumer supplier two-way communication, data transport and utilization of networking techniques like Field Area Networking helps in maintaining transparency and improving reliability and availability of the power system. The smart metering using Advanced Metering Infrastructure sustains the bidirectional data transfer and also reduction in the environmental effects. With this resilience and reliability of power utility network can be enhanced effectively. This paper describes the current development and technology advancement in smart grid infrastructure. The present issues and concerns related to smart grid need to be taken into account to help improvise the system efficiency.

This paper examines the minerals used in clean energy technologies (mainly solar energy, wind energy and electric vehicles), of which 12 elements are identified to be dependent on resources outside China. Therefore, a quantitative, relative assessment of short-to medium-term supply risks is measured for 12 elements by analyzing the following factors: country concentration, import reliance, import concentration, country risk, depletion time, companion metal fraction, recycling potential and substitutability. The results highlight four elements to present a high risk, namely: tin, cobalt, chromium and nickel; while lithium, copper and titanium are the most impossible to encounter a supply disruption; the remaining five elements (silver, cadmium, zirconium, manganese and selenium) appear a moderate risk. An uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo simulation shows a robust reliability on most of the 12 elements except for cobalt and tin. Mitigation strategies to alleviate the potential supply disruption are also discussed, such as broadening import sources; investing domestic and global mining; recycling and substitution; stockpiling. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Clean energy minerals; Energy security; Monte Carlo simulation; Supply risk","Climate change; Cobalt; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Intelligent systems; Minerals; Monte Carlo methods; Recycling; Reliability analysis; Solar energy; Tin; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Clean energy; Clean energy technology; Metal fractions; Mitigation strategy; Recycling potential; Robust reliability; Supply disruption; Supply risk; Risk assessment","China Geological Survey, CGS, (12120115056901)","This study was financially supported by the geological surveying projects of China Geological Survey (Grant No. 12120115056901 ).

In addition to fulfilling these objectives, PEVs can play a crucial role in balancing the active power as well as compensating the reactive power of the smart power grid. These ancillary services provided by PEVs, not only help in improving the reliability and quality of the power, but also benefit the grid operators and PEV owners financially. In this paper, a PEV-based reactive power compensation and a novel phase-detector-based feedback control system is proposed. The effects of reactive power compensation on the battery's State-Of-Charge (SOC) are investigated.

Besides, the rapid consumption of fossil fuels in transportation causes a rapid rise in air pollution surface temperature. Conventional fuel based combustion engines contain mechanical parts that make noise and require frequent maintenance. Pakistan imports a significant amount of hydrocarbons from neighboring countries. The import comes with huge costs and efforts, and therefore, relying on a fuel-based transportation system is one of the alarming situations. To address similar issues, many developed countries make plans and pass regulations to ban fuel-based vehicles, carried out research to reduce fuel consumption and noise, facilitate investors to promote the sale of eco-friendly vehicles.

In recent years, energy encryption has drawn researchers' attention to satisfy practical requirements of security and reliability in the theme of intelligent transportation and smart city. Especially for roadway-charging electric vehicles (EVs), the use of energy encryption can guarantee the transmitted energy being effectively harvested by the authorized receptors instead of being secretly stolen by the unauthorized ones. Recently, a chaotic encryption strategy based on switched capacitor arrays has been proposed to realize energy security in WPT systems [1, 2]. However, because of the need of discretely adjusting the resonant capacitance and hence the operating frequency, this encryption scheme suffers from the drawbacks of limited energy-transferred channels, high voltage stress across switches and relatively low flexibility. In addition, a generic encryption model based on certificate-less cryptography has been developed to improve the energy security performance for WPT systems [3], but its computational complexity and time involved seriously restrain from dynamically encrypting the operating frequency. Meanwhile, a traditional series-to-series (SS) topology with fixed values ofresonant inductance and capacitance has been identified to exhibit a selective characteristic for multiple loads when operating at the selected receptor's resonant frequency [4]. This mechanism can be newly extended to derive an energy-encrypted transmitter without using a switched-capacitor array for multiple energy receptors such as roadway-charging EVs. Consequently, in this paper, a switched-capacitorless energy-encrypted transmitter is proposed for roadway-charging EVs. Moreover, a two-dimension chaotic frequency-and-duration encryption (FDE) algorithm is proposed to improve the security performance while maintaining relatively high efficiency. © 2018 IEEE.","","Capacitance; Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Energy security; Energy transfer; Inductive power transmission; Natural frequencies; Transmitters; Electric Vehicles (EVs); High-voltage stress; Intelligent transportation; Practical requirements; Security and reliabilities; Security performance; Switched capacitor array; Wireless power transfer (WPT); Cryptography","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-153866425-4","","","English","IEEE Int.

Compared with other electric vehicles, electric buses have not yet been prevailingly adopted worldwide due to the high owning and operating costs, long charging time, and the uneven distribution of charging facilities. Moreover, the highly dynamic environment factors such as the unpredictable traffic congestions, different passenger demands, and even changing weather, can significantly affect electric bus charging efficiency and potentially hinder further development of large-scale electric bus fleets. To deal with these issues, in this paper, we first analyze a real-world dataset including massive data from 16,359 electric buses, 1,400 bus lines and 5,562 bus stops, which is obtained from the Chinese city Shenzhen, who has the first and the largest full electric bus network for public transit. Then we investigate the electric bus network to understand its operating and charging patterns, and further verify the feasibility and necessity of a real-time charging scheduling. With such understanding, we design bCharge, a real-time charging scheduling system based on Markov Decision Process to reduce the overall charging and operating costs for city-scale electric bus fleets, taking the time-variant electricity pricing into account. To show the effectiveness of bCharge, we implement it with the real-world streaming dataset from Shenzhen, which includes GPS data of the electric bus fleet, the bus lines and stops data, coupled with the 376 electric bus charging stations data. The evaluation results show that bCharge can dramatically reduce the charging cost by 23.7% and 12.8% electricity usage simultaneously. © 2018 IEEE.","charging scheduling; data-driven; Electric bus; Markov decision process","Air quality; Bus terminals; Bus transportation; Buses; Charging time; Cost reduction; Electric automobiles; Electric network parameters; Energy security; Fleet operations; Interactive computer systems; Markov processes; Operating costs; Real time systems; Scheduling; Traffic congestion; Urban growth; Charging efficiency; Charging facilities; Data driven; Dynamic environments; Electric bus; Electricity pricing; Electrified vehicles; Markov Decision Processes; Electric lines","National Key R&D Program of China, (2018YFB0803400); Rutgers Global Center; Rutgers Research Council, China 973 Program, (2015CB352400); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41401470, 61332018, 61772026)","This work is partially supported by Rutgers Global Center, Rutgers Research Council, China 973 Program (2015CB352400), National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) 41401470, 61772026 and 61332018, and National Key R&D Program of China 2018YFB0803400.","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10528725","978-153867907-4","PRSYE","","English","Proc.

However, oil's dominance may begin to be challenged by advancing technologies. Uncertainty about the security of oil supplies, the prospect of rising oil prices, and environmental concerns about carbon and other emissions from the combustion of petroleum-based fuels pose challenges to countries that are experiencing rapid motorization and have to import large portions of their transportation fuel supplies. As a result, future trends in transportation demand may be influenced significantly by government policies directed at reducing emissions and congestion while promoting alternative fuels, new vehicle technologies, and mass transit. Market forces and government policies may drive further development of highly efficient vehicle technologies, including hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), all-electric vehicles (AEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). The technologies are promising, with the potential to alter future demand for transportation fuels, reduce emissions, improve energy security, and provide significant energy savings. The market for High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs) in the transportation sector is potentially very large, especially if there is significant demand and market penetration for advanced vehicles. The steam-cycle HTGR is a demonstrated technology and could be deployed in a relatively short time frame to supply electricity for AEVs. Hydrogen production using thermochemical water splitting and high temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) are longer-term, developmental technologies that can be coupled to HTGRs to provide hydrogen for FCEVs. This paper provides specific analyses and comparisons of HTGR concepts with existing commercial nuclear and fossil-fueled plants in terms of potential CO2 reductions in the transportation sector.

The Brazilian scenario exhibits unique features, such as a powerful automotive sector with large investments in internal combustion engine technology and a well-established biofuels market based on flex-fuel technology. Although energy security, urban air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, and technological advantage have been common drivers for the adoption of electric vehicles worldwide, the Brazilian immediate motivations are dierent, and the biofuels business ecosystem is likely to transform the path for electromobility. High tag price and public charging infrastructure absence have deeply discouraged electric vehicles adoption. A lack of regulation and a national consensus about the role of electric vehicles have been notorious. In fact, only in 2018 did the electricity regulatory agency (ANEEL) issue a resolution permitting the sale of electricity for recharging. The objective of this review was to create an outlook of the Brazilian transportation landscape. We identified relevant players, public charging infrastructure initiatives, market and other barriers, and regulation actions by consulting academic literature, media sources, and reports. We do not claim to predict the evolution of electrification. Instead, we aim to consolidate the information which can be used for decision support or strategy definition among entrepreneurs or policymakers. The main findings here are the necessity of a model for electrification able to create a synergy with biofuels and the urgency of having well-defined policies on what Brazil wants from electromobility. © 2020 by the author.","Battery electric vehicles; Biofuels; Brazil; Charging infrastructure; Open standards","Automotive batteries; Biofuels; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Decision support systems; Electric utilities; Energy security; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Academic literature; Automotive sector; Business ecosystem; Charging infrastructures; Decision supports; National consensus; Regulatory agencies; Urban air pollution; Battery electric vehicles","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (PD-00063-3043/2018); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","Funding text 1: Funding: The authors would like to thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) for the financial support.; Funding text 2: Acknowledgments: We would like to thank CPFL Paulista for the partnership and the financial support of this project (PD-00063-3043/2018).","J.E.V.

In view of the large temperature difference of the battery module in high temperature environment, three optimization methods of the existing thermal management system of the battery pack were put forward: adjusting the installation position of the fan, optimizing the arrangement of the battery pack and reducing the fan opening temperature threshold. The feasibility of the optimization method is proved by simulation and experiment of the thermal management system of the optimized battery pack. © 2018 Author(s).","","","","","M.

Since these countries need to be self-sufficient in energy, there is a dilemma on the best way to reduce GHG while maintaining energy security. One way would be to drive the implementation of EVs for the transportation sector. However this can wreak havoc on the SIDS electrical network if not done properly. This paper reviews the possible effects of introducing EV charging on the grid. The authors have given Policy recommendations as to how EV penetration can be managed whilst maintaining the reliability and quality of the electricity grid. The authors also suggest a unique controller that can be used by the utility to limit charging time and window. © 2019 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

This in turn is also essential for significant improvements in the working of electric vehicles towards the development of efficiency of performance, utilization of energy and reduction of polluting emissions. Due to its ruggedness, the induction machine (IM) is usually preferred for electric drive in traction industry with additional advantages of dynamic modeling and similar torque-speed characteristics with that of the traction characteristics. Considering the braking performance of the IM, although regenerative braking is quite efficient in the context of energy regeneration but it has poor braking time performance. On the other hand plug braking is highly efficient in terms of fastness of braking but without any regeneration of kinetic energy being wasted during this process. In the present context a comparative analysis has been made between the performance of plug braking and regenerative braking, in order to develop an algorithm to utilize the advantages of both plug braking and regenerative braking simultaneously. © 2018 IEEE.","Electric traction; Induction machine; Plug braking; Regenerative braking; V/F control","Electric drives; Electric traction; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Induction motors; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Metal drawing; Regenerative braking; Smart city; Traction control; Traction motors; Comparative analysis; Energy regeneration; Induction machines; Induction motor drive; Research and development; Torque speed characteristic; Traction characteristics; V/f control; Braking performance","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-153864581-9","","","English","Int.

Making the best use of these mixed fleets presents a challenge for agencies since optimizing the assignment of vehicles to transit routes, scheduling charging, etc. require accurate predictions of electricity and fuel use. Recent advances in sensor-based technologies, data analytics, and machine learning enable remedying this situation; however, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no framework that would integrate all relevant data into a route-level prediction model for public transit. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the data-driven prediction of route-level energy use for mixed-vehicle transit fleets, which we evaluate using data collected from the bus fleet of CARTA, the public transit authority of Chattanooga, TN. We present a data collection and storage framework, which we use to capture system-level data, including traffic and weather conditions, and high-frequency vehicle-level data, including location traces, fuel or electricity use, etc. We present domain-specific methods and algorithms for integrating and cleansing data from various sources, including street and elevation maps. Finally, we train and evaluate machine learning models, including deep neural networks, decision trees, and linear regression, on our integrated dataset. Our results show that neural networks provide accurate estimates, while other models can help us discover relations between energy use and factors such as road and weather conditions. © 2020 IEEE.","","Data Analytics; Decision trees; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Electric automobiles; Energy security; Environmental impact; Fleet operations; Forecasting; Fuel storage; Fuels; Learning systems; Meteorology; Neural networks; Operating costs; Predictive analytics; Urban transportation; Accurate prediction; Data collection; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity use; High frequency HF; Internal combustion; Machine learning models; Prediction model; Digital storage","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE, (DE-EE0008467)","Acknowledgment: We thank the anonymous reviewers.

This study attempts to estimate annual vehicle kilometers traveled (AVKT) per privately-owned passenger vehicle and their daily distance patterns by vehicle class and geographic region. The data sample from a survey consists of 169,292 privately owned passenger vehicles, made by 177 car manufacturers during 2003–2018, running in 82 cities from 27 provincial regions. The log-transformed average AVKT is estimated to be 12,377 km with 95% probability ranging from 5490 to 28,579 km. The investigation reveals that vehicles from South China have the highest AVKT at 13,320 km. Generally, vehicles in small cities have higher AVKT than in big cities, except AVKT of tier 1 cities being higher. Another trend is that more expensive or larger vehicles tend to be driven more. A model is fitted for estimating AVKT based on region, city type, automaker, price range, and certain vehicle features including class and age. Data of daily commuting distances in recent years are also analyzed. The average daily commuting distances typically range from 21 to 28 km. Using the validated Gamma distribution method, daily distance distributions are specified for different regions. It is found that 99% of the daily driving distance is no more than 88.0–112.0 km, depending on region. Utility factors of plug-in electric vehicles are also estimated to be much higher than those based on driving data in the USA. These findings suggest global mitigations strategies on vehicle fuel use, electrification, and greenhouse gases should consider vehicle-use intensity at the regional level. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","China’s vehicle market; Daily commuting distance; Utility factor; Vehicle kilometers traveled; Vehicle-use intensity","China; United States; electric vehicle; electrification; estimation method; geographical region; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area","Aramco Services Company; Department of Energy User Facility; NHTS; National Transportation Research Center; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL, (DE-AC05-00OR22725)","Funding text 1:  The authors from Oak Ridge National Laboratory received financial support from Aramco Services Company. ; Funding text 2:  The authors would like to thank the ORNL colleagues on the NHTS project for their knowledge support and comments.

However, the construction and operation cost of EV charging facilities is high and the profit channel is single, which makes operators in a long-term loss state. It is necessary to study the participation of EV charging facilities in carbon trading in order to find new profit growth points. On this background, firstly, the calculation method of carbon emission of whole life cycle of EV charging facilities is studied from the construction stage and the operation stage, which shows that the carbon emission accounting has technical feasibility. Secondly, the economic benefits of EV charging facilities participating in carbon trading market is analyzed, which shows that participating in carbon trading has economic rationality. Finally, a case study of the carbon emission accounting and economic benefits of EV charging facilities participating in carbon trading is carried out.

In this regard, the prospects of producing carbon-neutral fuel from microalgae appear bright because of the unique features of microalgae and immobilized lipase have. Despite their obvious advantages over conventional feedstocks and catalysts, such processes are yet commercialized. In this chapter, a review on the biodiesel production from microalgae using immobilized lipases (future biodiesel) is discussed and compared to that produced from food and oils using chemical-based catalysts.

This chapter focuses on the prospective assessment of the carbon footprint of a national power generation system by combining life-cycle assessment (LCA) and energy systems modelling (ESM). Long-term energy planning is facilitated by considering not only a business-as-usual scenario, but also a number of alternative energy scenarios oriented towards (i) the extended operation of non-renewable power generation technologies, (ii) the implementation of novel energy policies on CO2 capture, energy security and externalities, and (iii) cross-sectoral issues such as the deployment of electric vehicles. Through the case study of the Spanish power generation sector, the convenience of promoting the evolution to highly renewable electricity production mixes is shown. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","","","Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, METI, (ENE2015-74607-JIN AEI/FEDER/UE)","This research has been partly supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (ENE2015-74607-JIN AEI/FEDER/UE).","D.

The industry recently appears to be in a downtown and fragile moment despite the price of oil is slowly rising. Renewable alternatives such as biofuels have gained increasing traction while petroleum fuel seemingly concedes to bio-fuels due to the rising public concern on the environment and stricter emission regulations. To be a strategic fuel in the energy security matrix, both fossil and bio-fuels options should be considered. However, the use of bio-fuels to achieve a degree of carbon neutrality is not without challenges. Among the challenges are land development and socio-political issue, carbon neutrality due to ILUC, high 2G bio-fuel feedstock and production cost, competing technology from electric vehicles and the impending fourth industrial revolution, NOx emissions and variation in biodiesel quality. This paper briefly reviews the potential of fuels source diversification and the challenges and how they can raise up to the challenges in order to be sustainable and attractive. In order to achieve this objective, first carbon credit through carbon trading needs to continue to stabilize the energy price. Second, 1G bio-fuel needs to forgo the use of natural, peat forest, rubber estate since these are an effective carbon sink and oxygen source. Third, advanced bio-fuels with high yield, process economics and sustainability need to be innovated. Fourth, the quality and standard bio-fuel that reduces NOx emission need to be improved. Finally and most importantly, carbon capture technology needs to be deployed immediately in fossil fuel power plants. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Costs; Crude oil; Emission control; Energy security; Fossil fuel power plants; Nitrogen oxides; Petrochemicals; Petroleum industry; Petroleum refining; Sustainable development; Carbon neutralities; Competing technologies; Emission regulation; Industrial revolutions; Land development; Process economics; Production cost; Socio-political issues; Biofuels","Ministry of Higher Education, MOHE","The authors gratefully acknowledge support from Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) for Geran Sanjungan Penyelidikan (GSP), Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia","","Evelyn null","Institute of Physics Publishing","17578981","","","","English","IOP Conf.

In this transport system, power is obtained from a battery to drive the electric motor, which finally propels the vehicle. Hence, high-performance batteries of reasonable cost are the fundamental requirement for transferring the transport system from conventional (vehicles using IC engines for power requirement) to newer, i.e., electric vehicles (EVs). In India, lead–acid batteries are produced mainly, while Li-ion batteries are utilized by top brand cars for propulsion purpose. Challenging parameters for production of batteries were identified. Various important characteristics which are utilized for classification and performance evaluation of the battery technologies were studied. Some of the battery technologies were explained briefly.

Compared with gasoline vehicles (GVs), EVs have no emissions and are more environmentally friendly to the sustainable transportation system. Since these two types of vehicles with different emission externalities and observable differences, in this paper, we propose a differentiable road pricing for EVs and GVs to simultaneously manage congestion and emissions by establishing a two-class bi-objective optimization (TCBO) model. First, we investigate whether the differentiable road pricing can induce user equilibrium pattern into a unique pareto-efficient pattern. Then performance of the bi-criteria system optimal is measured by bounding the deviation gap of the Pareto frontier. Specifically, we bound how far the total system travel time and total system emissions at a given Pareto optimum can deviate from their respective single-criterion based system optimum. Finally, we investigate the maximum efficiency gain of the bi-criteria system achieved through implementing differentiable road pricing by comparing total system travel time and total system emissions under two states. After defining two types of price of anarchy (POA), the theoretical bound for the worst possible ratio of total system travel time\ total system emissions in user equilibrium state to the total system travel time\ total system emissions in Pareto-efficient state is derived out. In order to validate the feasibility of theoretical bound, we conduct case studies to calculate the numerical bound of POA based on two Chinese cities: Shenzhen and Lasa. Overall, quantifying the maximum efficiency of differentiable road pricing is beneficial for improving the network designing, policy implementation and social efficiency with regard to congestion and emissions caused by EV and GV users. © 2020 Xi et al.

To ensure sustainable supply of electricity and energy security, the efficient management of the electricity distribution network through the use of intelligent devices, which can monitor and control power flows in real time, has become necessary. The major grid features sustainability, energy security, reliability etc. became the challenges of the 21th century grid management because of the grid interactive distributed renewable generation (DGs) and the increasing number of Electrical Vehicles. In order to manage the distribution network during a contingency condition, various options are explored for the maintenance of critical loads by fixing priority based on the criticality of loads. The restoration strategy formulated by integrating the DGs and Electric Vehicles (EVs) in a decentralized operation. Multi Agent System (MAS) have capabilities like standard interfaces, standard agent communication language, reactivity etc. that can be used for solving the problem associated with supply restoration when DGs are present. The energy restoration process is formulated as a multi objective optimization problem. This is formulated by maximizing the critical loads and minimizing the number of switching operation subject to the constraints voltage, current, Power, frequency and state of charge of EVs battery within the permissible limit. Algorithm is formulated to achieve the objectives. The power quality parameters System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) values are compared with the values of existing utility outage management system (OMS).

This can be made possible with the integration of renewable energy (RE) sources (mostly solar and wind). However, Reintegration with conventional grids brings with it grid stability issues, unpredictable and unbalanced supply and demand curves, reverse power flows ultimately resulting in blackouts as conventional grids are not ready to handle Reintegration. This is due to intermittent, variable, non-predictable, and location-specific generation profiles of renewables. All these challenges can be addressed using smart grid solutions integrating information and communication technology infrastructure with electricity infrastructure and adding intelligence to the combination. Smart technologies that can be readily implementable to overcome the above-addressed challenges are detailed in the paper. Some of these are demand response with customer engagement through smart meters, prosumers—encouraging customer feeding back to grid during peak demand through rooftop renewables, RE microgrids to feed a particular boundary isolated from conventional grid, smart inverters which act as storage devices and can feed AC back to grid, integrated storage using battery electric vehicles (BEVs), dynamic line rating using PMUs for real-time and enhanced loading and protection of feeders, etc. Benefits added to the utility and consumers of these technologies are discussed in detail. Electric mobility of transport is another key focus area worldwide due to depleting primary fuels and environmental (GHG) concerns. Major challenge to a distribution utility is the increased demand of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and the charging infrastructure required for EVs. Smart solutions result in new business opportunities for distribution utilities using EV charging infrastructure and also benefit the customer through offering credit for feeding back to grid during peak hours and emergency islanding conditions. This is possible through smart integration of EV with conventional grid through two-way (electrical and information) communication between a distribution utility and consumer. This paper highlights the challenges posed by the emergent requirement of EVs and smart grid solutions to overcome the hurdles of peak demand, renewable uncertainty, etc. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","BEV; Grid; ISGF; Microgrids; PMU; Renewable integration; Smart; xEV","Battery electric vehicles; Charging (batteries); Consumer protection; Economics; Electric lines; Energy policy; Energy security; Feeding; Integration; Plug-in electric vehicles; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Sustainable development; Vehicle-to-grid; Virtual storage; Grid; ISGF; Micro grid; Renewable integration; Smart; Electric power transmission networks","","","G.

Based on the findings, it seems that the prosperity of the PEV market, incentivized by the government, will continue in the short run. The direct subsidies to PEV from the government will gradually phase out, and the supply-side push policies such as the dual-credit policy and other charging infrastructure incentives will work as the invisible hand to force the automakers to invest more in the PEV segment. However, in the long run, innovation in PEV technology and business models, together with consumer acceptance will be the major factors that can sustain further market growth. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","China; Consumer behavior; Plug-in electric vehicle; Vehicle industry; Vehicle policy","","Aramco Services Company","Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Aramco Services Company for their generous financial support for this study, and the China Automotive Technology and Research Center for their data support.

The increase in pollution-related deaths due to conventional fossil fuels is making their use debatable every other day. In India, the road transport sector alone utilizes around half of the petroleum consumption. As per reports, the demand for petrol and diesel is increasing at a rate of 6.4% every year. This predicted trend of fuel consumption and growth in motor vehicles are making future energy security fragile. At this juncture, research is being carried out to find suitable alternatives for fossil fuels at least in non-commercial vehicles. Many alternatives such as alcoholic fuels, biodiesels, hydrogen, electric vehicles, and fuel cells are being proposed for their utilization in the present vehicle fleet. Among these alternatives, methanol and its blends stand out in the race. The availability of methanol from a wide variety of feedstock and its characteristics makes it an undeniable alternative for SI engines. Methanol contains ~ 50% inherent oxygen, which leads to cleaner combustion compared to gasoline and diesel. In this chapter, various properties of methanol which makes it a viable SI engine fuel are discussed in detail. The limitations of methanol and its blends in the SI engine are analyzed. The technical solutions available to overcome these limitations are presented in this chapter. The effects of using methanol and its blends on SI engine performance, combustion, and emissions are reviewed in detail. The requirement of catalytic convertors in methanol-fueled engines and design modification required for catalytic convertors for methanol operation are also discussed in the present chapter. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Alternative fuels and emissions; Blends of methanol; Methanol; SI engine","","","","D.B.

Transportation is one of the main consumers of fossil fuels, especially oil. The transportation share of the world’s total oil consumed in 2012 was 63.7%. Also, 23% of carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuels in 2012 was related to this sector. Replacing conventional vehicles with hybrid electric vehicles is among the best solutions for environmental and economic issues in the transportation sector. Considering the advantages of electric vehicles, their number is expected to increase rapidly over the next few decades. In 2022, more than 35 million electric cars are expected to be on the road. Electric vehicles must be connected to the power grid to charge their batteries. Therefore, with the widespread presence of these cars, the performance of the power system will change especially in the distribution network. Uncontrolled battery charging can cause undesirable effects such as overload, overvoltage, loss increase, unbalanced load, harmonic, and instability. Demand side management can prevent these problems, and it also flattens the demand curve. In order to solve the problems caused by the use of gasoline cars, it is expected that electric vehicles will gradually replace these cars. Lack of control in charging process will have adverse effects on the network. In this study, after modeling the electric car charging curve, its influence on network demand has been investigated in two uncontrolled charging and controlled charging scenarios. In this study, the controlled charge with the goal of minimizing household electricity consumption costs is investigated. The results show that the lack of control on the car charging time increases the peak demand, while the controllable charge does not increase the peak, and flattens the demand curve. The current chapter will discuss the application of electric vehicles in power grid and its role in demand response in order to improve the demand curve especially in smart homes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Controlled charging; Demand response; Electric vehicle; Smart home","","","","S.M.

Within bottom-up energy system modelling, two different approaches exist: one optimizes the energy mix of a selected future year, while a second optimizes the transition pathway between the current baseline and a future year. Markal/TIMES and OSeMOSYS are examples of valid modelling tools for both approaches. Due to computational issues, these models usually adopt low time resolutions and follow a time slice approach. The latter approximation is questionable given that renewables are intermittent and storage, stationary and in electric vehicles, is needed. To overcome the accuracy issue, a modelling approach based on a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and the EnergyPLAN software, which allows for year by year simulations with an hourly time-step, was introduced. The method that includes cost decrease of technologies year by year and decommissioning of old plants is applied to the Italian energy system. The results show the importance of timing in renewables capacity expansion planning.

The market success of FCEVs depends on standardization of key vehicle and infrastructure parameters, including the delivered hydrogen pressure (DHP). This study developed and utilized the Hydrogen Optimal Pressure (HOP) model to systematically identify the optimal DHP among 350, 500, and 700 bar toward the lowest total consumer cost and analyze how the optimal DHP may be affected by attributes of drivers, vehicles, and hydrogen refueling stations. The DHP of 700 bar a robustly better choice than 350 bar or 500 bar for Region Strategy, regardless of fuel availability, FCEV adoption, driver types, time values, and fuel economies. A DHP of 300 or 500 bar can the winner in Cluster Strategy if combined with certain assumptions of driving patterns and time value. the optimal pressure is found to be very sensitive to fuel availability, fuel economy, driving pattern and time value. The appeal of a higher DHP such as 700 bar (or even higher) is more obvious during the early market stages, when the number of hydrogen stations is limited and early FCEV consumers likely have higher time value, and thus may be willing to pay more for the increased range with higher DHP. Future research on mixed DHPs within a station and across stations is suggested. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Driving range; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Hydrogen fueling pressure; Hydrogen refueling station; On-board storage; Optimization","Commerce; Energy security; Fuel cells; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage; Optimization; Driving range; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Hydrogen pressures; Hydrogen refueling stations; Hydrogen station; On board storage; Pollution reduction; Transportation sector; Fuel economy","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office, HFTO","Funding text 1: This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

In order to reduce significantly the use of fossil fuels in urban mobility, whilst improving air quality and increasing the accessibility and attractiveness of urban areas, it is necessary to increase the use of non-conventionally fuelled vehicles for passenger and freight transport in urban areas. The introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) is a promising option, so as to achieve decarbonisation objectives, energy security, improved urban air quality and to increase energy efficiency. However, there are a number of challenges for the large-scale deployment of EV both on global and European level. These, in particular, are the high cost of the battery, lack of a standardised recharging infrastructure, relatively low range of battery electric vehicles or lack of interesting value proposition for consumers. A few studies have attempted to calculate the costs and benefits of EVs, but none consider the cost and benefits of EVs at a level of detail comparable to what has been performed for other vehicle technologies. This study constructs the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of EVs, based on real data from the auto-industry, in order to assess the costs and benefits as well as the potentiality of electro-mobility deployment in urban areas. © International Society of the Built Environment.","Costs and benefits; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; EV deployment; Smart cities; Total cost of ownership; Urban transport","Article; automobile industry; carbon footprint; controlled study; cost; cost benefit analysis; economic aspect; electric battery; electric vehicle; Greece; motor vehicle; priority journal; technology; urban area","","","E.A.

In recent years, research supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Fuel Cell Technologies Office has contributed substantially to the development and advancement of these technologies. The research investments to reduce costs in fuel cell stacks, for example, are clearly paying off, as commercial fuel-cell electric vehicles are being rolled out by major car manufacturers today. With increasing market penetration of FCEVs, enabling technologies for the affordable and widespread production of clean, renewable hydrogen is becoming increasingly important. Long term commercial viability of renewable hydrogen in the commercial marketplace will rely on continued materials research on several important fronts. Examples include the discovery and development of efficient, durable, and cost effective materials, devices and systems for hydrogen production based on: (1) low and high temperature advanced electrolysis powered by renewable electricity sources; (2) direct low-temperature photoelectrochemical water splitting powered by sunlight; and (3) direct high-temperature solar thermochemical water splitting. Research innovations in macro-, meso- and nano-scale materials are all needed for pushing forward the state-of-the-art in these areas. Such innovations are being facilitated by the DOE Energy Materials Network (EMN) initiative which aims to accelerate materials research and development (R&D) for clean energy applications through the streamlined utilization of advanced scientific resources in theory. computation, experimentation, analysis, and data informatics.

However finding an optimal battery size is of great importance for the overall economic and environmental performance of the PHEVs. This study investigates the resulting vehicle design, and fleet composition and performance when optimising the PHEV battery with respect to different objective functions possibly reflecting different actors' interest: number of PHEVs, cumulative cost savings and share of electric driving respectively under various assumptions concerning policies and costs. A recently available data set of car movements, containing 445 privately driven Swedish cars that have been measured with GPS-equipment for 1-2 months each is utilized to get a representative car fleet. We find that the battery size and fleet performance are heavily influenced by not only the choice of objective function for the optimization but also by its interaction with the cost structure and performance requirement in the transition from an energy efficient fuel-driven car to a PHEV. The effect of different policies may also vary depending on these conditions and may favour various actors' interests differently. We conclude that these aspects are important to consider both when designing vehicles and when formulating policies for the introduction of PHEVs. © 2013 IEEE.","battery; PHEV; policy objective; subsidies","Energy efficiency; Energy security; Environmental management; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Secondary batteries; Vehicle performance; battery; Economic and environmental performance; Fleet composition; Fleet performance; Objective functions; PHEV; Policy objectives; subsidies; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-147993832-2","","","English","World Electric Veh.

Electric vehicles, powered by lithium-ion batteries, have started to attain a noticeable market share recently due to their stable performance and maturity as a technology. However, electric vehicles continue to suffer from two disadvantages that have limited widespread adoption: charging time and energy density. To mitigate these challenges, vehicle Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) have developed different vehicle architectures to extend the vehicle range. This work seeks to compare various powertrains, including: combined power battery electric vehicles (BEV) (zinc-air and lithium-ion battery), zero emission fuel cell vehicles (FCV)), conventional gasoline powered vehicles (baseline internal combustion vehicle), and ICE engine extended range hybrid electric vehicle. The parameters of comparison are: energy consumption, range, life cycle and tailpipe emissions, cost, and customer acceptance. A unique zinc-air battery model was developed using the vehicle modelling software to perform the analysis, with consideration of research data, current market status, and controls logic of the dual energy systems powertrain. Modelling of the five powertrains was performed using the vehicle modelling software Autonomie. In correspondence with the EcoCar 3 competition [1], the 2015 Chevrolet Camaro was used as the vehicle architecture platform. A powertrain decision matrix was developed to compare these powertrains from the metrics of energy consumption, emissions, customer acceptance, and life cycle cost. Emissions analysis is completed as a Well-to-Wheel' analysis in order to take into account all sources of emissions production. As expected, all powertrains devoid of a gasoline internal combustion engine had lower tailpipe and greenhouse gas emissions. Powertrains powered by battery power alone, however, were not able to achieve the total range target, but it will be shown that developments in the metal-air battery will aid in addressing this limitation. © 2017 SAE International.","","Automobile manufacture; Automotive industry; Battery electric vehicles; Battery management systems; Combustion; Commerce; Competition; Energy security; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Exhaust systems (engine); Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Ion engines; Life cycle; Lithium-ion batteries; Metal analysis; Zinc; Conventional gasoline; Customer acceptance; Environmental policy; Extended-range electric vehicles; Internal combustion; Original equipment manufacturers; Security considerations; Vehicle architecture; Powertrains","","","J.

In response, many local and regional governments in China are pursuing an expanding array of measures to restrain growth in personal vehicle ownership and, along with the central government, reducing emissions and energy use of vehicles. One prominent strategy is the promotion of new energy vehicles, especially plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Large subsidies were offered-up to $ 27,600 (171,000. RMB) per vehicle in some regions, including almost $ 9200 (57,000. RMB) from the central government-which suggests that China is making a major commitment to PEVs. But sales have been meager. In 2013, only 17,600 PEVs, mostly buses and utility trucks, were sold, less than 0.1% of total civilian vehicle sales. Several factors explain the failure of PEV sales to take off: (1) protectionism by local governments; (2) uncertainty over which electric-drive vehicle technologies to promote and what consumers are willing to pay, (3) lagging investments in charging infrastructure, and (4) conservative investment behavior by automakers and battery manufacturers. The central government issued directives to local governments in late 2013 to reduce barriers to out-of-town companies, resulting in modest sales increases in early 2014, but a more coherent, broader, and effective set of policies, incentives, and strategies are needed to overcome consumer and industry resistance and the lack of charging infrastructure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Auto industry; Charging infrastructure; Local protectionism; Plug-in electric vehicle","China; Automobiles; Automotive industry; Charging (batteries); Consumer behavior; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; International trade; Investments; Sales; Traffic congestion; Utility trucks; Vehicles; Auto industry; Charging infrastructures; Electric-drive vehicles; Local protectionism; New energy vehicles; Plug-in Electric Vehicles; Regional government; Urban air pollution; car ownership; electric vehicle; energy use; investment; local government; transportation infrastructure; Automobile manufacture","Shanghai Pujiang Program, (14PJC058); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71402096)","This analysis was aided by interviews of representatives of automobile manufacturers, local governments, battery manufacturers, electric power companies, and consumer groups between September 2013 and January 2014, conducted by Marco Wan on behalf of the Shanghai office of the China Energy Fund Committee.

However a major barrier to the introduction of BEVs is their limited battery capacity and long charging durations. To address these issues of BEVs several solutions are proposed such as battery swapping and fast charging stations. However apart from these stationary modes of charging, recently a new mode of charging has been introduced which is called inductive charging. This allows charging of BEVs as they drive along roads without the need of plugs, using induction. But it is unclear, if and how such technology could be utilized best. In order to investigate the possible impact of the introduction of such inductive charging infrastructure, its potential and its optimal placement, a framework for simulating BEVs using a multi-agent transport simulation was used. This framework was extended by an inductive charging module and initial test runs were performed. In this paper we present the simulation results of these preliminary tests together with analysis which suggests that battery sizes of BEVs could be reduced even if inductive charging technology is implemented only at a small number of high traffic volume links. The paper also demonstrates that our model can effectively support policy and decision making for deploying inductive charging infrastructure. © 2014, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

Unfortunately, a great deal of charging EVs pose a newly added load to electric power systems and the total energy production cost of power systems consequently increases. An easy-solved methodology for scheduling charging EVs is therefore proposed here to minimize the total charging costs on the basis of unit commitment (UC) results. The marginal energy production cost for each dispatched hour is calculated based on the UC results, and then EVs are dispatched to be charged on the period with the minimum energy production cost in priority. The methodology is an iterating process that will not be finished until all EVs are dispatched. Simulation results on a case system are presented for verifying the feasibility of the proposed methodology.","Charging cost; Charging load; Electrical vehicle; Marginal cost; Unit commitment","Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Carbon emissions; Charging loads; Electric vehicle charging; Electrical vehicles; Energy productions; Marginal costs; Road transport systems; Unit commitment; Costs","","","","","","","978-184919758-8","","","English","IET Conf Publ","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893008641"

The modelling assessment spans the period 2010 to 2050 and analyses future EV demand in India under three scenarios: i) a ‘Reference’ scenario which includes the continuation of existing EV policies as outlined in India's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC); ii) a ‘EV policy’ scenario which, in line with India's INDCs, follows targeted supply-side push policies for EVs, but without the budget constraints; and iii) a ‘low carbon’ scenario which uses an exogenous price for CO2 in line with the global target of 2 °C temperature stabilization. The scenarios analysis delineates penetration of EVs and their co-benefits as well as co-costs. The co-benefits relate to local air quality, national energy security and CO2 emissions in India whereas the co-costs (risks) are related to sourcing of raw materials for batteries and battery reprocessing and disposal. The findings show that: i) in the reference scenario, the EVs 2-wheelers will achieve a significant share by 2050. Electric 4-wheelers though would have a small share even in 2050; ii) EV push policies though lead to significant diffusion of electric 2- wheelers in India by 2030. These policies enhance diffusion of electric 4-wheelers only if financial incentives are sustained in the long-term, iii) the application of global carbon price on the Indian economy in the 2° C stabilization scenario increases competitiveness of EVs and results in near total share of electric 2-wheelers by 2030 and a sizable share of electric 4-wheelers by 2050. The high and rising carbon price in low carbon scenario cause deep decarbonisation of electricity and enables EVs to deliver deep cut in CO2 emissions. The results show asymmetry in the impacts of national and global policies on co-benefits from EV. The EV supply-push policies deliver moderate benefits vis-à-vis air pollution and energy security indicators but make insignificant contribution CO2 emissions reduction. On the other hand, the global carbon price in the global 2° C stabilization scenario delivers sizable co-benefits vis-à-vis all three indicators. This asymmetry reveal important policy insights: i) the policy sequencing is vital to gain co-benefits, ii) EV technology push policies are good for creating early domestic market for a clean vehicle technology but they may not deliver sizable co-benefits vis-à-vis CO2 emissions which are global externalities, and iii) implementing strong climate policies early would lead to EVs delivering high co-benefits, in case of India, vis-à-vis all three indicators. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation; Cobenefits; Electric vehicle; Electricity demand","Air pollution; Air quality; Budget control; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Crashworthiness; Economics; Electric automobiles; Electric batteries; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy security; Forestry; Pollution; Risk perception; Secondary batteries; Stabilization; Vehicles; Cobenefits; Electricity demands; Emissions reduction; Energy system model; Financial incentives; Passenger transport; Scenarios analysis; Temperature stabilization; Carbon dioxide","","","S.

A high penetration level of RERs causes some problems to the grid operator, e.g., lack in primary reserve. Due to environmental concern and energy security risk, many countries around the world decided to increase their electric vehicles (EV) in the near future which provides a good chance to use them as a mobile battery energy storage system (BESS). This paper proposes a new scheme to provide necessary primary reserve from electric vehicles by using hierarchical control of each individual vehicle. An EV aggregator based on the vehicle's information such as the required state of charge (SOC) for the next trip, departure time, and initial SOC is proposed. The proposed aggregation scheme determines the primary reserve and contracts it with system operator based on electricity market negotiation. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is shown by the several simulation studies in the Taiwan power (Tai-power) system to enhance frequency nadir and steady state frequency after a large disturbance. © 2016 IEEE.","Primary frequency control; primary reserve; smart grid; Vehicle-to-grid","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric energy storage; Electric machine control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Energy resources; Energy security; Frequency response; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Solar power generation; Vehicles; Wind power; Battery energy storage systems; Environmental concerns; Primary frequency control; Primary reserve; Renewable energy resource (RER); Smart grid; Solar photovoltaic generations; Vehicle to grids; Electric power system interconnection","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-146738789-7","","","English","Iran.

These vehicles emit toxic gases, which results in environmental pollution and create massive health problem. For energy security and greener tomorrow, the concept of hybrid vehicle came into existence. Hybrid vehicles consist of alternative energy storages like fuel-cell, super capacitor, battery or hybrid storage. The presence of two power sources, i.e., engine and battery, makes it necessary to intelligently split the power between them to minimize the fuel consumption. An intelligent controller should be used to split the on road power demand for optimum fuel economy. This article applies a genetic algorithm based controller to toggle between engine and battery. The optimization is based on the selection of vital parameters such as state of charge in the battery, engine on time and power demand.

However, no comprehensive empirical tests of the Protection Motivation Theory in the slow onset environmental risk domain have been published yet to our knowledge. This paper aims at closing this gap. We first conceptualized the Protection Motivation Theory for the use in this environmental domain. Next, we present results of a questionnaire study among a large representative sample of Dutch drivers that showed that the Protection Motivation Theory is a relevant theory for modeling different indicators of full electric vehicle adoption. Notably, all theoretical antecedents proved to be significant predictors of different adoption indicators. Respondents were particularly more likely to adopt an electric vehicle when they perceived the negative consequences caused by conventional vehicles as more severe, and when they expected electric vehicles to decrease these consequences. The most important barriers for electric vehicle adoption were perceived high monetary and non-monetary costs of electric vehicles, and benefits associated with the use of a conventional vehicle. Interestingly, we found that environmental risks are more prominent in predicting close adoption indicators; while energy security risks are more prominent in predicting distant adoption indicators. As expected, our findings suggest that both collective concerns and individual concerns predict different indicators of adoption. Individual concerns (in particular perceived costs of driving an electric vehicle) played a more prominent role when predicting close measures of adoption, while collective concerns (e.g., perceived severity of environmental and energy security risks) played a somewhat more prominent role when predicting distant measures of adoption.

Schlesinger agreed to a new report released by the US Energy Security that while the US has made important strides in reducing crude oil imports, it will not ever be free of them as long as its transportation fuels are almost entirely petroleum-based, but only to a limited extent. Schlesinger argued that the US should move aggressively to supplement oil products in its transportation fleet with natural gas. As for ethanol and other nonfossil fuel sources, Schlesinger suggested that proponents are engaged in ""political incantations"". Globally, the US Energy Security report called for formation of a US-China-Brazil alcohol fuels initiative, which would welcome other countries with robust alcohol fuels programs; expansion of international collaborations on electric vehicles; development of international standards for auto aftermarket fuel retrofits; distribution of educational materials to foreign governments on the benefits of developing nonpetroleum transportation fuel alternatives; expansion of the US-China shale gas initiative; and full engagement in international efforts to reduce methane flaring.","","","","","","","PennWell Corporation","00301388","","OIGJA","","English","Oil Gas J.","Note","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84888095834"

Thus, governments have implemented incentive policies to stimulate the adoption of EVs. In this study, by linking Multi-criteria decision analysis and an energy system model, an evaluation framework of fiscal policies for the adoption of electric vehicles is developed. Primarily, the energy system model for Iceland is applied to compare the impacts of five fiscal policy incentives with BAU until 2050, in terms of government revenue, consumer's vehicle ownership cost, the GHG mitigation potential and energy security. Then, the policy scenarios are compared using the TOPSIS method. According to the estimated performance indexes for policy scenarios, Feebate+Tax scenario receives the highest rank. This ranking is consistent across different normalization norms and objective weights. In the Feebate+Tax scenario, a fee equivalent to 20% of conventional ICEV price is imposed on both petroleum ICEVs and HEVs, while an equivalent rebate value is provided to the purchase price of light-duty BEV and heavy-duty PHEV. In addition, an extra excise duty and a carbon tax are levied on petroleum fuels. The sensitivity of rankings with respect to the effects of different battery characteristics for EVs, is explored. Based on Pareto efficiency, the Feebate+Tax scenario was found to be the only non-dominated option across three objective weights. Thus, the recommendation of Feebate+Tax as the promising policy is unaffected by the variation in the range and cost of batteries. © 2017 The Authors.

In recent years, research supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Fuel Cell Technologies Office has contributed substantially to the development of these technologies. Enhanced performance and reduced cost in automotive fuel cells are important examples of achievement. The research investments are clearly paying off, as commercial fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are being rolled out by major car manufacturers today. With increasing market penetration of FCEVs, enabling technologies for the affordable and widespread production, storage and delivery of renewable hydrogen are becoming increasingly important. Long term commercial viability of hydrogen and fuel cells in the commercial marketplace will rely on continued materials research on several important fronts. Examples include the discovery and development of: (1) non-platinum-group-metal catalysts for next-generation fuel cells; (2) durable, high-performance photocatalytic materials systems for direct solar water splitting; (3) advanced materials-based systems for low-pressure, high-volumetric-density hydrogen storage; and (4) low-cost, hydrogencompatible pipeline materials for hydrogen delivery and distribution. Research innovations in macro-, meso- And nano-scale materials are all needed for pushing forward the state-of-the-art in these areas. New approaches in accelerated materials development facilitated by a national Energy Materials Network of advanced scientific resources in theory, computation and experimentation are being adopted at DOE. Application of these approaches to address the key materials challenges in hydrogen and fuel cell technologies are discussed. © 2016 Materials Research Society.","","Automobile manufacture; Automotive fuels; Catalysts; Commerce; Commercial vehicles; Computation theory; Energy security; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Gas fuel purification; Hydrogen storage; Investments; Nanotechnology; Solar power generation; Commercial fuel cells; Commercial marketplace; Enabling technologies; Fuel cell technologies; Materials development; Next generation fuels; Photocatalytic materials; U.S. Department of Energy; Fuel cells","DOE-EERE; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Oak Ridge Associated Universities, ORAU, (DE-AC05-06OR23100); Fuel Cell Technologies Office, FCTO","Funding text 1: Projects funded by FCTO’s Hydrogen Delivery sub-program study the compatibility; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by an award from the DOE-EERE Science and Technology Policy Fellowships administered by ORISE for the DOE.

The development of electric vehicles has been determined to be the national strategy for solving these problems. By the end of 2015, China had become the world's largest electric vehicles market, but its core technologies are still less competitive in the global marketplace. A scientific national strategy for 2016 to 2020 is expected to play a critical role in China becoming the global leader in the electric vehicle industry. The research process for this strategy includes a review of the technologies for electric vehicles, market analyses, benchmarking of the top levels in the field, and expert interviews. By these approaches, the strengths and weaknesses of China's electric vehicle technologies and industry are assessed. Competitive and feasible quantitative goals for key components and powertrains are proposed by this paper, and a core issue has been determined to be the need to improve the safety of high-energy density traction batteries. Improving the power density of electric control units is expected to the core for electric vehicles' electronics and control systems. Key problems for the fuel cell stacks used in cars and buses have been identified by this paper to be, respectively, power density and durability. Long-range plug-in hybrid electric powertrains are the optimal candidate for Chinese plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Lightweight material, intelligent driving technologies and special electric chassis are set to be the focus for improving the energy efficiency of battery electric vehicles.

Energy consumption in Japan's transport sector has been dominated by petroleum, and CO2 emissions in this sector account for 20% of Japan's CO2 emissions. Therefore, the deployment of clean energy vehicles, such as EV and PHEV, is expected to play a significant role in tackling energy security and environmental concerns. In order to assess the energy and environmental benefits of EV and PHEV, we develop an energy system model integrating an optimal power generation mix model and a vehicle penetration model, with consideration of the optimal electricity charging profile of those advanced vehicles. The calculated results suggest that massive EV penetration serves as an energy saving measure in Japan's whole energy system due to significant petroleum reductions exceeding the growth of fuel input into the power generation sector derived from significant EV and PHEV penetration. Massive EV deployment is estimated to contribute to CO2 mitigation in the energy system as well. Evaluating CO2 emissions by mileage by automobile, however, carbon emissions by mileage for EVs is almost equivalent to that of gasoline hybrid vehicles (HEVs) in the case of decommissioning of nuclear power plants, which eventually causes a higher carbon intensity of the electricity supply. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","electric vehicle; optimal power generation mix model; plug-in hybrid vehicle; vehicle penetration model","Automobile plants; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Electric vehicles; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy utilization; Gasoline; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Petroleum transportation; Clean energy vehicles; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy-saving measures; Environmental benefits; Environmental concerns; Optimal power generation mixes; Power generation mix; Vehicle penetration; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","","","","","John Wiley and Sons Inc.","04247760","","EENJA","","English","Electr Eng Jpn","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925397524"

Lower emission, convenient charging experience, high performance, and energy security are considered as the significant benefits of the mentioned technology. Despite the aforementioned advantages, inappropriate place and size of CSs have brought new challenges for electric distribution systems. Prominent features of distributed generations (DGs) make this technology appropriate for compensating relevant problems of CSs installation. In this paper, simultaneous optimal planning (placing and sizing) of CSs and DGs is presented to address new challenges. In addition, financial (investment costs), technical (system reliability, power loss, and voltage profile), and environmental (CO2 emission) issues are considered in the proposed objective function. A genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, the simulation study is carried out on a 33-bus radial distribution network. The simulation results show the effects of installation of CSs in the presence/absence of DGs on total costs, reliability, loss, voltage profile, and emission.

This paper presents the implementation of plug-in hybrid technology on a two wheeler by formulation of novel control strategy suitable for Indian city driving needs. Experimental investigations on hub motor and IC (internal combustion) engine has been carried out to fix the change-over speed in hybrid mode, followed by road test on prototype vehicle. The performance of prototype vehicle on IDC (Indian driving cycle) simulated road pattern and actual road driving, confirmed the change-over speed of vehicle in hybrid mode. The converted plug-in hybrid electric two wheeler also demonstrated the drive strategy adopted for higher energy efficiency up to 2.5 times.

It reveals that, (i) ICEVs is already in booming stage and will last 16-18 years. (ii) EVs has a golden stage which will last 13-14 years, and before this prospective stage, there is an initial slow growth period which will probably last 10-11 years.

This paper explores the ability of three transport strategies to contribute to the development of a sustainable transport in China. With this purpose in mind, a Chinese transport model has been created and three current transport strategies which are high speed railway (HSR), urban rail transit (URT) and electric vehicle (EV) were evaluated together with a reference transport system in 2020. As conservative results, 13% of the energy saving and 12% of the CO2 emission reduction can be attained by accomplishing three strategies compared with the reference transport system. However, the energy demand of transport in 2020 with the implementation of three strategies will be about 1.7 times as much as today. The three strategies show the potential of drawing the transport demand to the more energy efficient vehicles; however, more initiatives are needed if the sustainable transport is the long term objective, such as the solutions to stabilise the private vehicle demands, to continuously improve the vehicle efficiency and to boost the alternative fuels produced from the renewable energy sources.

The Fukushima nuclear power plant accident triggered by the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami led to a mass shutdown of all the nuclear plants in Japan, a stoppage that is still in effect. In this paper, we review the energy supply situation and some social problems faced by rural areas in Japan. Given that lifestyles in rural Japan are reliant on automobiles, there is significant demand for the establishment of a sustainable mobility society. Furthermore, Japan is now entering an aging society ahead of other countries. In order to enhance the vitalization of rural areas and accelerate the establishment of sustainable society, our project developed low-CO2-emission vehicles (i.e., a single-driver EV [micro-EV] and a low-speed E-bus) for elderly people and tourists through the cooperation of regional industries, a local university, and a city office.

Addressing energy security and GHG emissions is a national priority. Replacing conventional vehicles with electric vehicles (EVs) offers a potential solution to both issues. While the reduction in petroleum use and hence the energy security benefits of switching to EVs are obvious, the GHG benefits are less obvious. We examine the current Chinese electric grid and its evolution and discuss the implications for EVs. China's electric grid will be dominated by coal for the next few decades. In 2015 in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, EVs will need to use less than 14, 19, and 23 kWh/100 km, respectively, to match the 183 gCO2/km WTW emissions for energy saving vehicles. In 2020, in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou EVs will need to use less than 13, 18, and 20 kWh/100 km, respectively, to match the 137 gCO 2/km WTW emissions for energy saving vehicles. EVs currently demonstrated in China use 24-32 kWh/100 km. Electrification will reduce petroleum imports; however, it will be very challenging for EVs to contribute to government targets for GHGs emissions reduction. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","","Carbon Dioxide; China; Coal; Electric Power Supplies; Electricity; Energy-Generating Resources; Gases; Gasoline; Government; Greenhouse Effect; Power Plants; Vehicle Emissions; China; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy security; carbon dioxide; coal; gasoline; petroleum; Electric grids; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity generation; GHG emission; GHGs emissions; Guangzhou; Oil import; alternative fuel; carbon dioxide; demand-side management; electric vehicle; electricity generation; electrification; emission control; emission inventory; energy conservation; energy planning; greenhouse gas; article; carbon footprint; China; Chinese; coal mining; controlled study; electric car; electricity; energy conservation; energy consumption; energy security; government; motor vehicle; nuclear energy; reduction; traffic and transport; Greenhouse gases","","","W.

It does so by looking at four overarching concerns for decision makers; energy security, sustainable development, impact on the existing automotive sector and the pressure from sub-national actors. The paper seeks to show that national policy in the five selected countries is heterogeneous in nature making consistent, standardised approaches to policy implementation a challenge, despite the similarity in ambition to advance instances of electromobility and to transition from conventional transport technology to alternative fuel vehicles.

Hydrogen fuelling stations are one of the most important parts of the distribution infrastructure required to support the operation of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles. If there is to be substantial market penetration of hydrogen vehicles in the transport sector, the introduction of commercial hydrogen vehicles and the network of fuelling stations to supply them with hydrogen must take place simultaneously. The present paper thus reviews the current state of the art and deployment of hydrogen fuelling stations. It is found that by 2013, there were 224 working hydrogen stations distributed over 28 countries. Some 43% of these stations were located in North and South America, 34% in Europe, 23% in Asia, and none in Australia. The state of the art in the range of hydrogen production processes is briefly reviewed. The importance of producing hydrogen using renewable energy sources is emphasised for a transition to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to contribute to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. 2.3-5.8/H2kg for SMR A classification of hydrogen refuelling stations is introduced, based on the primary energy source used to produce the hydrogen, the production process, and whether the hydrogen is made on site or delivered to the site. The current state of deployment of hydrogen fuelling stations in each major region of the world is then reviewed in detail. The costs of producing hydrogen vary from $1.8 to 2.9/H2 kg for Coal gasification, 2.3-5.8/H2 kg for SMR, $6-7.4/H2 kg for wind power and $6.3-25.4/H2 kg depending on the cost of the PV system. The lowest cost of hydrogen is nearing competitiveness with petroleum fuels. Finally conclusions are drawn about the progress to date in establishing this crucial component of the infrastructure to enable hydrogen-powered vehicles to become a commercial reality. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines how electrified vehicles (EVs) can help reduce China's energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the future. Here EVs include hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), and battery electric vehicle (BEV). First, this study uses an Electricity Supply and Emissions Model to forecast the GHG emissions intensity factors of China's electric grid under three renewable generation adoption scenarios. Then, it uses a China FLEET model to project the stock, energy demand, and GHG emissions of the LDV fleet for different scenarios out to 2050. Results show that there is significant potential for electrification to reduce the energy demand, oil dependence, and GHG emissions of the LDV fleet, because of the high efficiency of EVs, and especially BEVs. Compared to growing the renewable energy contribution to the electricity supply system, expanding EVs in the fleet can occur faster, provided that they become more attractive relative to conventional gasoline vehicles. To help China reverse the rising trajectory of CO2 emissions by 2030, the aggressive EV scenario and the more-renewables electricity scenario will likely be needed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China's in-use fleet; Electric vehicle; Energy consumption; GHG emissions; Model forecasting; Renewable electricity generation","China; Battery electric vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Vehicles; China's in-use fleet; Conventional gasoline; Electrified vehicles; GHG emission; Model forecasting; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Renewable electricity; Renewable generation; alternative energy; electric vehicle; emission control; energy efficiency; energy planning; energy policy; environmental impact; future prospect; greenhouse gas; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","","","S.J.

The development of new energy vehicles (NEVs) is considered an optimal technological route for solving such problems. By the end of 2015, China had become world's largest plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) market; however, the core technologies associated with PEVs remain less competitive in the world marketplace. Thus, determining the global trend and national development laws is very important for the Chinese government to draft long-term technological strategies and lead the NEV industry. In this study, the international technological trend is analyzed and industrialization progresses of top global countries are compared. NEV development is reviewed through a detailed classification and a triple-perspective method to determine the industrialization rules. The review indicates the following. (i) China's NEV market penetration, particularly for commercial electric vehicles, is dominated by state policies. The subsidy policy has a significant influence on powertrain options; therefore, the current incentive polices should be optimized. (ii) The range-extended-type plug-in hybrid electric cars have been verified as the optimal roadmap, and plug-in hybrid electric sports utility vehicles hold great promise in the future Chinese market. (iii) Micro-electric cars dominate the electric car market and are expected to be commercialized first when the government subsidy phases out. (iv) The industry has grown rapidly and the charging infrastructure construction can keep up with the progress of PEV market penetration. The post-EV market (such as battery and vehicle recycling) must be considered in advance. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Charging infrastructure; Electric vehicles; Incentive policies; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Traction battery","China; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Commercial vehicles; Electric traction; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Hybrid vehicles; Plug-in electric vehicles; Vehicles; Charging infrastructures; Detailed classification; Incentive policies; National development; Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV); Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Sports utility vehicles; Traction battery; atmospheric pollution; commercialization; electric vehicle; energy market; energy policy; equipment component; future prospect; incentive; industrialization; infrastructure; literature review; national security; optimization; technological development; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71403142); Key Technologies Research and Development Program, (2016YFB0101801)","This study is sponsored by National Key Technologies R&D Program (2016YFB0101801) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71403142).

Therefore, a fuel diversification is needed to improve the energy security, and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) seem promising in giving an alternative solution. However, PEV owners need electric power from the grid in order to recharge the batteries of their vehicles. PEV charging load is a new type of demand, influenced by additional factors such as travel and driving patterns. Average travel distance within a day, the connection and disconnection time and the PEV’s power consumption will directly affect the daily load curve. This chapter proposes a decentralized control algorithm to manage the PEV charging requests. The aim of the control algorithm is to achieve a valleyfilling effect on the demand curve, avoiding a potential increase in the peak demand. The proposed model includes an algorithm for PEV short term load forecasting. This forecast contributes to the effectiveness of the control model. Through different case studies, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated and the value of the PEV load forecasting as part of the PEV load management process is illustrated. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2015.","Data mining; Energy management; PEV load forecast; Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV)","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/E036503/1, EP/I038756/1, EP/L001039/1, EP/M507131/1)","","","","Springer Verlag","16121287","","","","English","Power Systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921773858"

The key aspect of the approach is the quantification of smart charging processes in energetic and economic perspectives. It was found that the implementation has significant energetic and thus economic benefits because of an improved integration of the additional electricity demand.

The choice of energy strategy has significant implications for the Asian region as well as domestically. This paper examines these scenarios and the energy strategy as a whole with regards to its achievability and outcomes. The analysis is based on modeling of the existing energy system of Japan with projections based on the government strategy out to the 2030s. Under all the scenarios, it is likely that a small increase in energy security will be obtained, but the achievement of environmental commitments is less likely. The paper points out that, while largely internally consistent, the government's strategy does not consider cross-sectoral policy widely enough. A number of alternative integrated policy options are also presented which are proposed to enable greater potential for practical achievement of the government's goals. Ultimately, it is anticipated that an approach which involves much greater integration at domestic (rural-urban development), energy system wide (electric vehicle and decentralized energy integration into the energy supply grid) and regional (co-operation in development of resources in areas of contested ownership) levels, could enhance the energy supply security and stability of the region as well as Japan itself. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Fukushima; Integrated policy; Japan; Nuclear; Renewable energy; Scenarios","Energy management; Energy policy; Energy security; Nuclear energy; Urban growth; Fukushima; Japan; Nuclear; Renewable energies; Scenarios; Public policy","","","B.C.

However, the rollout of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) and hydrogen retail stations (HRS) requires substantial investments with high risks due to many uncertainties. We compare retail infrastructure costs on a common basis - cost per mile, assuming fueling service to 10% of all light-duty vehicles in a typical 1.5 million person city in 2025. Our analysis considers three HRS sizes, four distinct types of EVSE and two distinct EVSE scenarios. EVSE station costs, including equipment and installation, are assumed to be 15% less than today's costs. We find that levelized retail capital costs per mile are essentially indistinguishable given the uncertainty and variability around input assumptions. Total fuel costs per mile for battery electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) are, respectively, 21% lower and 13% lower than that for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) under the home-dominant scenario. Including fuel economies and vehicle costs makes FCEVs and BEVs comparable in terms of costs per mile, and PHEVs are about 10% less than FCEVs and BEVs. To account for geographic variability in energy prices and hydrogen delivery costs, we use the Scenario Evaluation, Regionalization and Analysis (SERA) model and confirm the aforementioned estimate of cost per mile, nationally averaged, and estimate a 15% variability in regional costs of FCEVs and a 5% variability in regional costs for BEVs.","","Battery electric vehicles; Costs; Economics; Energy security; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Plug-in electric vehicles; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Sales; Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE); Geographic variability; Infrastructure costs; Light duty vehicles; Social and environmental; Substantial investments; Transportation sector; Uncertainty and variability; Cost benefit analysis","","","M.W.

Currently, 35% of global lithium production being used for LIBs and consumption for estimated LIB demand could be 66% (out of global lithium production) by 2025. During last five (2011–2015) years, global lithium production is almost constant. At present, up to 3% of LIBs are recycled with the only focus of valuable metal recovery, but motivation on lithium recovery almost nonexistence. The global rate of lithium recycling is only < 1%. Considering the current global lithium production with respect to projected demand, environment and regulation, green energy and energy security, cradle-to-cradle technology management and circular economy of critical metal and minimization of waste crime and maximization of the urban mining, recovery and recycling status of lithium should be well understood. In this review recovery of lithium from various resources such as different ores, clay, brine, seawater and recycling of battery by different technique are reviewed. Lithium recovery from various primary resources and its separation purification by different routes such as hydrometallurgy, pyro-metallurgy, chemical metallurgy, and bioleaching are discussed. Lithium recovery through chemical leaching, bioleaching, and floatation of different ores also thoroughly reviewed. The extraction of lithium from seawater by co-precipitation and extraction, ion-exchange and sorption by using various organic, inorganic and composite polymer sorbents has been discussed thoroughly. Although, several industries recovering lithium from primary resources, but lithium recovery from secondary resources almost non-existence. The non-existence of lithium recovery process from LIB or techno-economically inefficient process is a greater challenge for the projected lithium demand. As the cradle-to-grave technology is a sustainability challenge, cradle-to-cradle technology management could be achieved through efficient recycling.

The electrification of transport is a promising option for the transition to a low carbon energy and transport system. But on the short term, the electrification of transport also creates risks. More specifically, when promising technological such as vehicle-to-grid and smart-grids are not yet available on a large scale, the rapid diffusion of electric vehicles and the recharging behaviour of consumers can create risks for grid functioning. In order to assess these risks, this paper present a GIS-based simulation method that assesses electricity demand and supply on the neighbourhood level. The paper combines local level electric vehicle diffusion forecasts, with neighbourhood level data about the grid additional capacity. Application of the model to the Netherlands shows that risks for grid functioning already appear as early as 2015. More specifically, the diffusion of electric vehicles is found to compromise the functioning of the grid on the short term in densely populated areas such as Amsterdam. In these neighbourhoods early and fast adoption of electric vehicles coincides with the presence of an older grid with less additional capacity. The model provides insights for grid operators as well as for policy makers that seek to stimulate the transition to sustainable energy and transport systems, and can be used as a strategic tool to plan (smart) grid investments. © 2014 The Authors.","Distribution networks; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Energy security; Energy transition; Smart grids","Amsterdam [North Holland]; Netherlands; North Holland; Diffusion; Electric automobiles; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Energy security; Investments; Risk assessment; Supply chains; Electricity demands; Energy transitions; Low carbon energies; Rapid diffusion; Smart grid; Sustainable energy; Transport supply; Transport systems; alternative energy; electric vehicle; electrification; energy planning; GIS; policy making; population density; Smart power grids","","","J.W.

Enabling cost-effective electric-drive systems requires reductions in inverter power semiconductor area, which increases challenges associated with heat removal. In this paper, we demonstrate an integrated approach to the design of thermal management systems for power semiconductors that matches the passive thermal resistance of the packaging with the active convective cooling performance of the heat exchanger. The heat exchanger concept builds on existing semiconductor thermal management improvements described in literature and patents, which include improved bonded interface materials, direct cooling of the semiconductor packages, and double-sided cooling. The key difference in the described concept is the achievement of high heat transfer performance with less aggressive cooling techniques by optimizing the passive and active heat transfer paths. An extruded aluminum design was selected because of its lower tooling cost, higher performance, and scalability in comparison to cast aluminum. Results demonstrated a 102% heat flux improvement and a package heat density improvement over 30%, which achieved the thermal performance targets. © 2014 IEEE.","aluminum extrusions; electric drive; electric vehicle; heat exchanger; inverter; power electronics; thermal management; water-ethylene glycol","Aluminum; Automobile electronic equipment; Automotive fuels; Chip scale packages; Cooling; Cooling systems; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Electric drives; Electric power system economics; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Environmental technology; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Fuel economy; Heat exchangers; Heat flux; Heat resistance; Power electronics; Power semiconductor devices; Temperature control; Aluminum extrusion; Double-sided cooling; Electric drive system; Enabling technologies; Environmental concerns; inverter; Semiconductor packages; Thermal management systems; Heat transfer performance","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-147995267-0","PITEF","","English","Therm Phenom Electron Syst Proc Intersoc Conf","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907707974"

In recent years, research sponsored by the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Fuel Cell Technologies Office (FCTO) has made significant contributions to the development of these technologies. With fuel cell electric vehicles beginning to be introduced to the market, enabling technologies for the widespread production of affordable hydrogen are becoming increasingly important. One of the more versatile hydrogen production pathways is based on splitting water via either electrolytic, photoelectrochemical, or thermochemical routes. For these advanced water splitting (AWS) technologies, there are tradeoffs amongst efficiency, durability, and cost at the materials, device, and system levels that need to be balanced for low cost hydrogen production. Recent advances have been made in catalytic materials for AWS to improve these attributes; however, further developments, from new materials to scale-up of state-of-the-art (SOA) materials, are required to reach large scale technoeconomic viability. Research innovations to advance the SOA in AWS materials are being facilitated by the DOE ""HydroGEN"" Energy Materials Network (EMN) consortium.

The use of conventional hybrid electric vehicles reduces WTW petroleum use and GHG emissions by 33% compared to gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). Using fossil fuels-derived natural gas for electricity and hydrogen production reduces WTW GHG emissions of battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles by 56% and 39%, respectively, compared to gasoline ICEVs.

There are, however, substantial technical, social, and economic barriers to widespread adoption of electric vehicles, including vehicle cost, small driving range, long charging times, and the need for a charging infrastructure. In addition, people are unfamiliar with electric vehicles, are uncertain about their costs and benefits, and have diverse needs that current electric vehicles might not meet. Although a person might derive some personal benefits from ownership, the costs of achieving the social benefits, such as reduced GHG emissions, are borne largely by the people who purchase the vehicles. Given the recognized barriers to electric-vehicle adoption, Congress asked the Department of Energy (DOE) to commission a study by the National Academies to address market barriers that are slowing the purchase of electric vehicles and hindering the deployment of supporting infrastructure. As a result of the request, the National Research Council (NRC)-a part of the National Academies-appointed the Committee on Overcoming Barriers to Electric-Vehicle Deployment. This committee documented their findings in two reports-a short interim report focused on near-term options, and a final comprehensive report. Overcoming Barriers to Electric-Vehicle Deployment fulfills the request for the short interim report that addresses specifically the following issues: infrastructure needs for electric vehicles, barriers to deploying the infrastructure, and possible roles of the federal government in overcoming the barriers. This report also includes an initial discussion of the pros and cons of the possible roles. This interim report does not address the committee's full statement of task and does not offer any recommendations because the committee is still in its early stages of data-gathering. The committee will continue to gather and review information and conduct analyses through late spring 2014 and will issue its final report in late summer 2014. Overcoming Barriers to Electric-Vehicle Deployment focuses on the light-duty vehicle sector in the United States and restricts its discussion of electric vehicles to plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), which include battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The common feature of these vehicles is that their batteries are charged by being plugged into the electric grid. BEVs differ from PHEVs because they operate solely on electricity stored in a battery (that is, there is no other power source); PHEVs have internal combustion engines that can supplement the electric power train. Although this report considers PEVs generally, the committee recognizes that there are fundamental differences between PHEVs and BEVs. © 2013 by the National Academy of Sciences.

However, the introduction of EVs poses major challenges for power system operation. With increasing penetration of EVs, uncontrolled coincident charging may overload the grid and substantially increase peak power requirements. Developing smart grid technologies and appropriate charging strategies to support the role out of EVs is therefore a high priority. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of distributed additive increase and multiplicative decrease (AIMD) charging algorithms, as proposed by Stüdli et al. in 2012, at mitigating the impact of domestic charging of EVs on low-voltage distribution networks. In particular, a number of enhancements to the basic AIMD implementation are introduced to enable local power system infrastructure and voltage level constraints to be taken into account and to reduce peak power requirements. The enhanced AIMD EV charging strategies are evaluated using power system simulations for a typical low-voltage residential feeder network in Ireland. Results show that by using the proposed AIMD-based smart charging algorithms, 50% EV penetration can be accommodated, compared with only 10% with uncontrolled charging, without exceeding network infrastructure constraints. © 2013, SAGE Publications.

Green growth rests upon the need to convert economies from being resource-intensive to being low carbon and resource efficient aimed at addressing, among key challenges, ecosystems decay, biodiversity loss, climate change, water stress, and energy security. To this end, the use of renewable energy as well as clean and energy efficient technologies is now inevitable. Among such clean and energy efficient technologies today are electric vehicles, especially battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Could green growth transition be a game changer offering multiple tipping points against the ICE? This is a question the paper addresses. The paper presents arguments that contribute to current global debates regarding the role of renewable energy as well as clean and energy efficient technology in green growth, especially in the transport sector. The paper conclusion is that, yes, if there is global scaling up, green growth signals the inevitable death of the ICE in the not so distant future. © 2014 WIT Press.","Combustion engine; Electric vehicles; Game changer; Green growth","alternative energy; combustion; economic growth; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; engine; fuel cell; renewable resource","","","","Al-Kayiem H.H.; Zubir S.S.; Brebbia C.A.; Wessex Institute of Technology, Ashurst Lodge, Ashurst, Southampton, SO40 7AA","WITPress","17433541","978-184564837-4","","","English","WIT Trans.

China has invested much to develop electric vehicle technologies. For EVs' penetration, China government develop 'ten-city one thousand-EVs' demonstration program in 25 cities from 2008. For mass penetration of EVs, there still exist many challenges, especially for electric car for private use. How to promote EVs application based on present electric powertrain technologies has become an urgent demand for China government. Targeting to propose a kind of comprehensive trade-off method and to get the optimized powertrain parameters, such as battery capacity, in this paper, the simulation models were setup in Matlab/Simulink. The energy consumption model was setup, and based on that model, electricity consumption efficiency of electric sedan under NEDC and China city passenger car driving cycle were analyzed and compared. Based on energy consumption of a conventional reference car and a BEV, a comprehensive trade-off method for the average car user is proposed targeting to China market. The method takes into account the traction battery technology status and forecasting, vehicle daily kilometers travel, operating duty cycle, purchase price, fixed annual costs and operating costs, policy of EVs, etc. By the analysis, it can be concluded that A-compact type BEV, the AER designed sweet region should be no more than 200km under weight constrain. With higher battery capacities the amortization time becomes significantly longer, but from the systematic view, it is the less economical. Based on above analysis, the most cost-benefit designed AER with 50km VKDT should be 80km from view of minimum TCO of life cycle. So the optimized installed battery capacity threshold based on China VKDT is highly recommended. And the subsidy policy for EV should be modified more reasonable. © 2013 IEEE.","all electric range; battery capacity; cost-benefit; electric cars; trade-off design","Costs; Depreciation; Economic and social effects; Electric automobiles; Energy security; Energy utilization; Life cycle; MATLAB; Operating costs; Powertrains; Secondary batteries; Battery capacity; Cost benefits; Electric cars; Electric range; Trade-off design; Cost benefit analysis","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-147993832-2","","","English","World Electric Veh.

Among the renewable power generation technologies, wind power generation takes a key share of load supply. However, the wind is intermittent and its output needs to rely on auxiliary supports to uniformly serve the energy customers. The emerging plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are a potential solution to mitigate intermittent effects of wind power outputs. PHEVs can provide a battery based energy storage solution to smooth intermittent outputs of wind power and they have the mobility advantage. This paper investigates the ability of PHEVs to enhance the reliability of an unbalanced power system that is integrated with wind farms. Operational characteristics of PHEVs are modelled by incorporating charging and discharging rates, depth of discharge, and their state of charge at times of use. Case studies suggest that strategic integration of PHEVs provides a considerable opportunity for wind power generation to be present in a power system in addition to the enhancement of reliability of power supply. Results argue that the level of PHEV supports does not necessarily correlate with the integration capacity of wind. © 2014 IEEE.","Intermittent power outputs; PHEVs; reliability indices; wind energy","Charging (batteries); Climate change; Electric discharges; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Energy security; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Reliability; Wind power; Operational characteristics; PHEVs; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Power out put; Reliability Index; Reliability of power supply; Renewable power generation; Unbalanced power system; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-147993561-1","","","English","Int.

In such way, the energy can be wirelessly transferred to authorized EVs, while unauthorized EVs cannot illegally acquire the electric energy without knowledge of the security key.

Most studies in this area have been conducted on only a few types of powertrains, e.g. EVs and gasoline vehicles; to fill this gap, this study will cover FCVs, CNGs, hybrid electric vehicles, diesel hybrid electric vehicles and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vehicles. This research is novel because it includes energy security aspects, uses scenario analysis and investigates FCVs. This study aims to predict an optimal AFV portfolio based on different scenarios to sustain energy security in light of gas and petroleum restrictions until 2030. To do this, we will present four scenarios that consider improvements in technology, energy security requirements, decreasing petroleum prices and government subsidies. The Polish market is considered as a case for demonstrating the optimal model. The results indicate that it is crucial to introduce all types of powertrains to achieve both economic and energy security objectives. The projected diffusion of FCVs will be more pronounced than that in previous studies, owing to the expected rapid decline in the cost of both infrastructure and purchase price of cars. Furthermore, the projected deployment of AFVs in transportation systems in this study will mostly occur in the form of lorries (trucks) and passenger vehicles. Because CNG vehicles are expected to achieve a high degree of diffusion in the transportation system, the government should seek a reliable CNG supply. Overall, this research will help automakers and policymakers recognise investment possibilities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative fuel vehicles; Energy security; Gas dependency; Optimisation; Petroleum dependency; Portfolio","Alternative fuels; Automobiles; Compressed natural gas; Costs; Energy security; Energy utilization; Fuel cells; Global warming; Hybrid vehicles; Investments; Liquefied petroleum gas; Powertrains; Transportation; Vehicles; Alternative fuel vehicles; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Electric Vehicles (EVs); Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Optimisations; Portfolio; Reducing energy consumption; Technological advancement; Natural gas vehicles","Keio Research Grants for Global Initiative Research Projects; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (26380475)","This research was supported by Keio Research Grants for Global Initiative Research Projects (Safety).","K.

Hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles are a few such examples. Such diversification requires the use of power control units essentially for power control, power conversion, and power conditioning applications such as variable speed motor drives (dc-ac conversion), dc-dc converters and other similar devices. The power control unit of a hybrid electric vehicle or electric vehicle is essentially the brain of the hybrid system as it manages the power flow between the electric motor generator, battery and gas engine. Over the last few years, the performance of this power control unit has been improved and size has been reduced to attain higher efficiency and performance, causing the heat dissipation as well as heat density to increase significantly. Efforts are constantly being made to reduce this size even further. As a consequence, a better high performance cooler/heat exchanger is required to maintain the active devices temperature within optimum range. Cooling schemes based on multiple parallel channels are a few solutions which have been widely used to dissipate transient and steady concentrated heat loads and can be applied to existing cooling system with minor modifications. The aim of the present study has therefore been to study the various cooling options based on mini-channel and rib-turbulated mini-channel cooling for application in a hybrid electric vehicle and other similar consumer products, and perform a parametric and optimization study on the selected designs. Significant improvements in terms of thermal performance, reduced overall pressure drop, and volume reduction have been shown both experimentally and numerically. This paper is the first part in a two part submission and focuses on the design and evaluation of mini-channel and ribturbulated mini-channel cooling configurations. The second part of this paper discusses the manufacturing and testing of the cooling device. © 2013 by ASME.","Automotive application; Electronic cooling; Mini-channel; Power converters for HEV; Ribbed mini-channel; Thermal management","AC generator motors; Consumer products; DC-DC converters; Design; Electric drives; Electric vehicles; Electronic cooling; Hybrid systems; Hybrid vehicles; Petroleum deposits; Power control; Temperature control; Automotive applications; Automotive technology; Concentrated heat loads; Cooling configuration; Design and evaluations; Mini channels; Optimization studies; Power converters for HEV; Cooling","","","V.

The distributed nature of this generation technology has the additional advantages of (i) reducing electrical transmission and distribution losses, (ii) alleviating the peak demands on the central power plants, and (iii) diversifying the electrical energy production, thus improving the security of energy supply. Micro-cogeneration devices are used to meet both electrical requirements and heat demands (for space heating and/or hot water production) of a building; they can be also combined with small-scale thermally fed or mechanically/electrically driven cooling systems. Many micro-cogeneration units are already commercialized in different countries (such as Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, etc.) and in recent years several researches have been carried out in order to advance the design, operation, and analysis of this technology. Currently the use of commercial micro-cogeneration units in applications such as hospitals, leisure facilities, hotels, or institutional buildings is well established. The residential cogeneration industry is in a rapid state of development; the market remains not fully mature, but interest in the technology from manufacturers, energy utilities, and government agencies remains strong. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Absorption heat pumps; Adsorption heat pump; Cogeneration; Distributed polygeneration; Electric heat pumps; Electric vehicles; Energy; Energy saving; Environment; Fuel cell; Internal combustion engine; Load sharing; Micro-cogeneration; Microtrigeneration; Microturbine; Photovoltaic thermal; Renewable sources; Stirling engine; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Trigeneration","Automobile cooling systems; Automobile manufacture; Cooling systems; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy resources; Energy security; Energy utilization; Engines; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat pump systems; Internal combustion engines; Stirling engines; Sustainable development; Absorption heat pumps; Adsorption heat pumps; Cogeneration; Energy; Environment; Load sharing; Micro cogeneration; Micro turbine; Microtrigeneration; Photovoltaic thermals; Poly-generation; Renewable sources; Tri-generation; Cogeneration plants","","","A.

In order to relieve those problems, new energy vehicles are introduced into the bus and car market. We adopt life cycle analysis to evaluate the well-to-wheels (WTW) energy consumption, CO2 emissions and pollutant emissions from the traditional diesel bus and new energy buses, including diesel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), compressed natural gas vehicles (CNGVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). This study reports the current situation and projects future scenarios for the BEV bus for several regions in China due to significant regional differences in the power generation mix. Compared to the diesel bus, the HEV bus can reduce petroleum, fossil fuel use and CO2 emissions by about 20%, and, at the same time, produce stable reduction benefits for all air pollutants. The CNG bus achieves reductions of WTW primary PM2.5 emissions by 70% over its diesel counterpart and, of course, uses little petroleum; but increases fossil fuel consumption moderately and has no benefit in GHG emissions. The BEV bus can deliver a substantial petroleum consumption advantage and greatly reduce the WTW NOX, VOC and CO emissions; but, if the electricity is generated from burning coal, the BEV bus has no PM2.5 emission benefit compared to the conventional diesel bus. Currently, the BEV bus increases fossil energy use and CO2 emissions in the coal-dominated regions; but, in the future, it can achieve substantially lower fossil energy use and CO2 emissions with more penetration of clean electric energy. To reach the win-win strategy, a city's initial reliance on diesel buses for the public fleet has to give way to a mixture of these new energy buses; and the fleet mix should be diversified over the region and modified over time to accommodate changes in these energy and environmental parameters. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollution; CNG bus; CO<sub>2</sub>; Electric bus; Energy security; Life cycle analysis","China; Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Compressed natural gas; Energy security; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Life cycle; Natural gas; Natural gas vehicles; Pollution; Vehicles; Battery electric vehicles; Electric bus; Energy conservation and environmental protections; Environmental parameter; Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); Life cycle analysis; Petroleum consumption; Regional differences; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; diesel; energy conservation; energy use; environmental protection; fossil fuel; fuel; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; particulate matter; petroleum; pollution control; power generation; traffic emission; Fleet operations","National High Technology Research and Development Program (863) of China, (2013AA065303); National Science & Technology Pillar Program of China, (2013BAC13B03); Energy Foundation, EF, (G-1104-14046); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51322804, 51378285); Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality, CICREQ; Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GIZ","This study was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51322804 and 51378285 ), the National High Technology Research and Development Program (863) of China (No. 2013AA065303 ), the National Science & Technology Pillar Program of China (No. 2013BAC13B03 ), the Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality, the Energy Foundation (G-1104-14046), and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).

It was recognized in 2003 by the National Academy of Engineering as the preeminent engineering achievement of the twentieth century. The grid and its importance to our economy, our national security, and to the lives of the hundreds of millions it serves, remains a critical national engine, but we have taken this marvelous machine for granted for far too long. Because electricity and electronic devices now permeate every facet of our lives, the demands placed upon the grid are growing exponentially. The utility industry is facing a number of challenges that are bringing about the need to make major changes to the grid. These challenges include: (1) the need for greater energy security arising from increasing demand for energy worldwide and decreasing supply of fossil fuels to meet the demand; (2) worldwide concern about global climate change; and (3) aging infrastructure and inefficiency in the existing grid. Additionally, consumers want to play a role in their own energy management and conservation. Integration of information and communication technologies with the traditional electric power infrastructures and the creation of an interoperable, scalable, and flexible smart grid will require numerous technological innovations and advancements. The purpose of this chapter is to take a detailed look at the various technologies, which may be utilized in data transmission for the smart grid and the problems or difficulties that must be overcome to effectively use them. A variety of wireless systems are analyzed and we discuss the security of these mediums, as privacy remains a major obstacle for implementing smart grid technology.

As a result, new energy vehicles (NEVs) have been strongly supported by government's policy privilege. But at this stage, these preferential policies are facing updates and adjustments to meet the current development of NEV industry and consumer demand of purchase. This means that an understanding of the NEV purchasing behavior in China, what the current policy is, and how to respond to its adjustment are of theoretical and practical significance for China's NEV industry. To this end, a reliable scale is developed in this study to investigate the situation in seven Chinese geographical regions and 22 provinces. Based on application of an extended theory of planned behavior model to the real situation, a structural equation model is used to analyze the factors affecting the NEV purchasing intentions of residents. The results show that financial benefits, infrastructure readiness, environmental concerns, and policy privileges have a positive impact on purchasing intention. However, the NEV's cruising range does not. Based on the paper's findings, we have discussed whether current subsidies and preferential policies reflect consumers' potential purchase demand, how to make subsidies more tangibly targeted, and thereby present some proposals for manufacturing strategy under the influence of policy and demand of consumers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Empirical study; Government policy privilege; New energy vehicle; Purchasing intention","Electric vehicles; Geographical regions; Vehicles; China; Empirical studies; Environmental concerns; Environmental pollutions; Manufacturing strategy; New energy vehicles; Structural equation modeling; Theory of Planned Behavior; Sales","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71403021, 71521002, 71573016); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFA0602504); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, (71625003)","This study is supported by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (Reference No. 71625003), National Key Research and Development Program of China (Reference No. 2016YFA0602504), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Reference No. 71573016, 71403021, 71521002).

Although policies addressing the two issues sometimes benefit one at the expense of the other, technology innovation, especially in alternative energy, provides a win-win solution to tackle both issues. This paper examines the effect of oil endowment on the patterns of technology innovation in the transportation sector, attempting to identify drivers of technology innovation in alternative energy. The analysis employs panel data constructed from patent data on five different types of automobile-related technologies from 1990 to 2002: oil extraction, petroleum refining, fuel cells, electric and hybrid vehicles (EHV) and vehicle energy efficiency. I find that countries with larger oil endowments perform less innovation on refining and alternative technologies. Conversely, higher gasoline prices positively impact the patent counts of alternative technologies and energy efficiency technology. The findings highlight the challenges and importance of policy designs in international climate change agreements. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate policy; Fossil fuel endowment; Technology innovation","Climate change; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Engineering research; Hybrid vehicles; Patents and inventions; Petroleum refining; Technology; Alternative technologies; Climate Change Agreements; Climate policy; Electric and hybrid vehicles; Energy efficiency technologies; Energy supply security; Technology innovation; Transportation sector; alternative energy; climate change; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; environmental policy; fossil fuel; fuel cell; innovation; technological development; Innovation","","","J.E.

The significant growth of automobile ownership in emerging countries is likely to increase world oil demand and the associated carbon dioxide emissions. In order to address these energy, security, and environmental concerns, the deployment of clean energy vehicles, such as EV and PHEV, is expected to play a crucial role due to their high fuel efficiency. Consequently, we develop both a global energy system model and a world vehicle penetration model, which can explicitly analyze the impact of EV introduction into the seasonal daily electric load curve, with consideration of the specific electricity charging profile through 2050. The simulation results confirm that EV deployment contributes to energy conservation, because oil demand reduction outstrips the growth in electricity demand and the associated fuel input into the power generation mix. Concerning carbon dioxide abatement, the magnitude of the impact relies on the carbon intensity of the power generation mix. If the intensity is low enough to guarantee a carbon mitigation effect due to EV fuel saving, emissions reduction is well assured. It should be noted, however, that in regions with high carbon intensity in the power generation mix, carbon emissions per mileage of EVs is almost equivalent to that of efficient gasoline vehicles such as hybrid vehicles, and the figure for PHEV is slightly higher than for hybrid vehicles. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Specifically, we investigate how to better deliver the value of EVs by improving designs in the power system and charging strategies, given expected developments by 2030 in both the power system and EV penetration levels. The impact of EV charging is quantified by applying an integrated transportation-power system model on a set of scenarios which represent uncertainties in charging strategies. We find that deploying EVs essentially shifts the use of gasoline to coal-fired power generation in China, thus leading to more coal consumption and CO2 emissions of the power system. Economically, EVs outperform gasoline-powered vehicles in terms of average fueling costs. However, the impact of EVs in terms of CO2 emissions at the national level largely depends on the charging strategy. Specifically, controlled charging results in more CO2 emissions associated with EVs than uncontrolled charging, as it tends to feed EVs with electricity produced by cheap yet low-efficiency coal power plants located in regions where coal prices are low. Still, compared with uncontrolled charging, controlled charging shows absolute advantages in: (1) mitigating the peak load arising from EV charging; (2) facilitating RES generation; and (3) reducing generation costs and EV charging costs. Hence, in light of this trade-off of controlled charging with the goals of energy security, economic efficiency and reducing environmental impacts, policy interventions in the Chinese power system should opt for controlled charging strategies in order to best realize the benefits of EVs. Accordingly, this paper proposes that increasing the use of cleaner forms of electricity generation, such as RES power and gas power, and establishing energy efficiency and CO2 emission regulations in power dispatch are critical for China. Lastly, this work illustrates what the optimized charging profiles from the power system perspective look like for different regions. These results can inform Chinese policy makers in creating a better integration of the transportation and the power system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Charging; China; Electric vehicles; Energy-economic-environmental implications; Power system","China; Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Charging (furnace); Coal; Costs; Crashworthiness; Economic and social effects; Electric load dispatching; Electric power generation; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Environmental impact; Gasoline; Public policy; Vehicles; China; Coal-fired power generation; Electric vehicle charging; Electricity generation; Environmental implications; Integrated transportations; Power system; Uncontrolled charging; carbon dioxide; cost analysis; electric vehicle; emission control; energy planning; energy use; environmental impact; environmental policy; trade-off; Electric power system economics","","","Y.

However, there is a considerable amount of uncertainty regarding the market penetration of electric vehicles that must be accounted for in order to achieve the current market share goals. This paper aims to address these inherent uncertainties and to identify the possible market share of electric vehicles in the United States for the year 2030, using the developed Electric Vehicle Regional Market Penetration tool. First, considering their respective inherent uncertainties, the vehicle attributes are evaluated for different vehicle types, including internal combustion engine, gasoline hybrid, and three different electric vehicle types. In addition, an agent-based model is developed to identify the market shares of each of the studied vehicles. Finally, market share uncertainties are modeled using the Exploratory Modeling and Analysis approach. The government subsidies play a vital role in the market adoption of electric vehicle and, when combined with the word-of-mouth effect, may achieve electric vehicle market share of up to 30% of new sales in 2030 on average, with all-electric vehicles having the highest market share among the electric vehicle options. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Agent-based modeling; Electric vehicle; Exploratory modeling and analysis; Inherent uncertainty; Market penetration","United States; Alternative fuels; Autonomous agents; Commerce; Competition; Computational methods; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Internal combustion engines; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicles; Agent-based model; Alternative fuel technologies; Government subsidies; Inherent uncertainty; Market penetration; Model and analysis; Transportation sector; Word-of-mouth effects; alternative fuel; combustion; diesel; electric vehicle; energy use; liquefied petroleum gas; market system; national security; numerical model; uncertainty analysis; Electric power system interconnection","U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT; University of Central Florida, UCF, (DTRT13-G-UTC51)","This work was supported in part by an award to the University of Central Florida , as part of grant number DTRT13-G-UTC51 from the US Department of Transportation's University Transportation Centers Program.","M.

Since the generation of electricity from these plants is essentially dependent on the weather conditions, the choice of the weather year in the modeling plays a not insignificant role in the analysis of such scenarios. The Fraunhofer IWES energy system model SCOPE models the sectors of electricity, heat and transportation for Europe in detail and calculates cost-optimal investment and operating decisions for a wide range of technologies while respecting emission targets. In an analysis for a climate protection target scenario with a reduction in emissions of 95 % for the year 2050 seven different historical weather conditions were compared. The operating decision shows that comparatively low back-up power capacities are necessary with regard to security of supply, provided that a high degree of flexibility of hybrid heat supply systems and controlled charging of electric vehicles is present. At the same time, supraregional electricity trading in Europe is gaining in importance, especially to compensate for weather effects. With the help of power-to-gas, a CO2-free supply of back-up power plants as well as of industrial processes can be ensured. It was also shown that the choice of the weather year has a high influence on the investment decision results. Among 2006 to 2012 the weather year 2011 is best suited to model the effects of future climate change. For assessing security of supply for operating or also for investment decisions, sections of the weather year 2010 appear more suitable. © VDI Verlag GmbH, Düsseldorf 2017.","","Climate models; Electric power system control; Energy security; Gas plants; Investments; Wind power; Back-up power; Climate protection; Condition; Cost optimized; Decarbonisation; Energy supply system; Installed power; Investment decisions; Security of supply; Wind power plants; Climate change","","","","","VDI Verlag GMBH","00835560","978-318092291-1; 978-318092292-8; 978-318092293-5; 978-318092294-2; 978-318092295-9; 978-318092296-6; 978-318092297-3; 978-318092298-0; 978-318092299-7; 978-318092300-0; 978-318092301-7; 978-318092302-4; 978-318092303-1; 978-318092304-8; 978-318092305-5; 978-318092306-2; 978-318092307-9; 978-318092308-6; 978-318092309-3; 978-318092310-9; 978-318092311-6; 978-318092312-3; 978-318092313-0; 978-318092314-7; 978-318092315-4; 978-318092316-1; 978-318092319-2","VDIBA","","German","VDI Ber.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105991217"

First, the structural risk management system of China needs to be optimised as a hedge against energy security risks from a growing future dependency on oil imports and also from geographical ubiquity in coal. Second, these risks force the Chinese Government to promote eco-innovation through the coal-electricity integration project. Plugging EVs into the electricity grid will not only enhance coal-fired power plant efficiency but also improve the efficiency of energy use from renewable sources. In 2010, the Chinese EV market was still small with annual sales less than 15,000 units. However, the low-speed EV market has grown rapidly, expanding by two or three times in the last ten years. This study focuses on firm growth using case studies on BYD Auto and Baoya New Energy Vehicle and clarifies that a market-oriented thinking, rather than a technology-oriented thinking, can contribute to further growth in the Chinese EV business.

However, the market acceptance of PEVs in the future remains largely uncertain from today's perspective. By integrating a consumer choice model based on nested multinomial logit and Monte Carlo simulation, this study analyzes the uncertainty of PEV market penetration using Monte Carlo simulation. Results suggest that the future market for PEVs is highly uncertain and there is a substantial risk of low penetration in the early and midterm market. Top factors contributing to market share variability are price sensitivities, energy cost, range limitation, and charging availability. The results also illustrate the potential effect of public policies in promoting PEVs through investment in battery technology and infrastructure deployment. Continued improvement of battery technologies and deployment of charging infrastructure alone do not necessarily reduce the spread of market share distributions, but may shift distributions toward right, i.e., increase the probability of having great market success. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Charging infrastructure; consumer choice; electric vehicles; energy transition; market penetration; Monte Carlo simulation","Charging (batteries); Commerce; Competition; Electric automobiles; Electric batteries; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Intelligent systems; Investments; Mobile telecommunication systems; Plug-in electric vehicles; Probability distributions; Secondary batteries; Vehicles; Battery technology; Charging infrastructures; Consumer choice; Energy transitions; Infrastructure deployments; Market penetration; Nested logit model; Technology portfolios; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; energy use; infrastructural development; logit analysis; marketing; Monte Carlo analysis; social policy; sustainability; Monte Carlo methods","","","C.

Among the renewable power technologies, the wind power takes a considerable share to supply the electricity demand in many networks. The wind is intermittent and its power output needs an auxiliary support to serve the energy customers and to limit impacts. The emerging battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are a potential source that can be used to mitigate intermittent effects of wind power outputs in modern distribution networks. BEVs are inherited with the mobility advantage and they can be used as a battery-based energy storage solution to smooth intermittent power outputs. Taking into account the mobility advantage of BEVs, the paper investigates the strategic ability of them to enhance the reliability performance of an unbalanced power distribution network by incorporating the provision of smart coordination of vehicles. Operation of BEVs is characterized by using charging and discharging rates, depth of discharge, and their states of charge at times of operation. A set of case studies were performed by integrating generic distribution network models to a power transmission network model. The results suggest that strategic operation of BEVs can potentially provide a considerable opportunity to build capacity required for wind power in smart power distribution systems. Results also depict that the necessary BEV capacity to mitigate wind impacts on reliability does not necessarily correlate with installed capacities of wind plants. A quantitative assessment provides detailed information of impact thresholds. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.","","Climate change; Crashworthiness; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Greenhouse gases; Vehicle performance; Vehicles; Wind power; Battery electric vehicles; Performance assessment; Power distribution network; Quantitative assessments; Reliability performance; Renewable power generation; Smart distribution networks; Smart power distribution systems; Secondary batteries","","","","","American Institute of Physics Inc.","19417012","","","","English","J.

However the impact of fuel efficiency standards is greater than is sometimes appreciated, especially if reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy security are key benefits in electric vehicles.

To help reach lifetime economic parity with conventional combustion engines, the parked vehicles will be used in vehicle to grid mode for frequency regulation and peak shaving. After termination of vehicle leases, these batteries will be used for second life stationary grid service and energy security operations. One challenge of providing such services is to control the battery operations to achieve revenue and savings without excessive wear on the battery, which would incur high replacement costs. An analysis by MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MITLL) of charging infrastructure and V2G services shows this to be economically feasible in many locations. Software is described to implement peak shaving, including automated adaptation to new installations, and allowing frequency regulation when not shaving, and achieve this desired tradeoff. Frequency regulation is shown to be benign for most batteries due to shallow depth of discharge, when properly limited by inverter ratings and battery thermal characteristics. This software and its related communications equipment have been tested by operation of a modified electric van for peak shaving services at MITLL, and by use of plug in medium duty trucks in the DoD Smart Power Infrastructure Demonstration for Energy Reliability and Security (SPIDERS) microgrid experiment at Ft. Carson, CO. Operations at 16 other installations have been simulated using real site load data. Battery usage characteristics are established for both peak shaving and frequency regulation services, and combined with driving usage over a repeated US06 cycle. The effect of these on battery capacity fade are calculated using a lithium ion battery aging model to assess all life cycle costs and value. The results of simulations and testing are presented, and support the feasibility of the concept. © 2014 IEEE.","Battery; Grid; Plug-in; Vehicle","Charging (batteries); Electric discharges; Energy security; Life cycle; Lithium-ion batteries; Network security; Plug-in electric vehicles; Software reliability; Software testing; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicles; Battery; Charging infrastructures; Communications equipment; Conventional combustions; Frequency regulation services; Grid; Plug-ins; US Department of Defense; Battery management systems","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-147994064-6","","","English","IEEE NewNEB DC Util.

However, despite what seem on the surface obvious benefits to purchasers, to date sales have been slow in most markets, this despite the significant sums invested in electrification infrastructure to date. For example, in 2009, ECOtality was awarded US $99.8 million from the US Department of Energy (DOE) to deploy electricity chargers in major cities and metropolitan areas across the US. In addition, drivers who qualified received a residential charger at no cost and reduced labor charges for installation. ECOtality is one of the largest electric vehicle charging companies partnering with Nissan Leaf. In 2010, ChargePoint, a provider of electric vehicle charging infrastructures, received a $15 million matching grant funded by the US government to install 4600 home, public, and commercial charging points in the US. ChargePoint also received an additional $3.4 million from the California Energy Commission to install residential and commercial charging points in the State of California. ","J.

Electric vehicles (EVs) have many benefits as compared to conventional gasoline cars. Moreover, electrification of transportation systems would enable increased electricity generation from carbon-free and renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydro. It is anticipated that the electric utility and transportation systems in the United States will become increasingly integrated and indistinguishable from each other due to the electrification of the transportation system. This panel will consist of researchers coming from academy and industry. The presentations by the panel will give a broad coverage from electric vehicles to integration and impact of electric vehicles to the grid. From vehicle perspective, the panel will focus on typical EV configurations, challenges associated with EV energy management and high performance traction control technology using artificial neural networks. Regarding EV grid integration, the panel will discuss charging management of EVs, EV integration with renewables, and techniques of using a fleet of EVs in support of automatic generation control in a smart grid framework.

Heavy traffic congestion poses a great challenge in improvement of fuel economy. Nowadays urban climatic condition forces the passenger to keep air-conditioning (AC) on; thus further decreasing the fuel economy. In a typical urban drive; the vehicle commutes with low speed forcing IC Engine to run in its low efficiency operational points. Further it is characterized by frequent start-stop and crawling. It has been observed that the power consumption for AC is comparable to that required for the vehicle propulsion. Hence the AC on condition with propelling vehicle demands higher power from engine creating a challenge for fuel economy improvement. It is observed in literature and simulation exercises that the fuel economy sharply falls with AC on condition in urban drive cycle and worsens in frequent start-stop and city traffic crawling. A study is required to study the improvement of fuel economy in a hybrid vehicle with AC on condition. Most of the work published in literature focuses on improvement in fuel economy with hybridization without air-conditioning operational. The paper describes the techniques to improve fuel economy of a hybrid electric vehicle with AC on condition for a typical urban and city traffic crawling conditions. The hybrid configuration selected for study is a parallel hybrid with dual AC clutch which enables the drive of AC compressor by electric motor or IC Engine. Different hybrid control strategies for AC control, with compressor driven by IC engine alone; electric motor alone and blend of both were simulated for fuel economy on various city and city traffic drive cycles. The AC compressor drive control was based on vehicle speed; gradient requirement; Battery SOC; idle start-stop conditions and gear engaged. The control strategy parameters for IC Engine shut-off at different battery SOC levels; torque split quantity from both electric motor and IC engine for vehicle propulsion and AC compressor load sharing by electric motor and IC engine, based on battery SOC and vehicle demand were optimized to achieve maximum fuel economy. An improvement of 25-30 % in fuel economy was achieved with optimized AC control over the conventional vehicle in all city traffic conditions. All the simulations were done without downsizing the AC compressor; thus providing the same comfort to the passenger as experienced in conventional vehicles. Thus it has been found out that optimized control of Dual clutch AC in hybrid vehicle plays a significant role in fuel economy improvement. The enhanced performance of the hybrid vehicle is achieved with keeping the AC capacity at par with the conventional vehicle. © 2017 SAE International.","","AC motors; Air conditioning; Air quality; Charging (batteries); Compressors; Crude oil; Energy security; Fuel economy; Fuels; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Motor transportation; Propulsion; Secondary batteries; Traction motors; Traffic congestion; Climatic conditions; Compressor driven; Control strategies; Hybrid configurations; Hybrid control strategies; Optimized control; Simulation exercise; Vehicle propulsion; Electric machine control","","","","","SAE International","01487191","","","","English","SAE Techni.

However, they introduce new uncertainties related to their environmental, economic, and social impacts and certain challenges for widespread adoption. In this study, a novel method, uncertainty-embedded dynamic life cycle sustainability assessment framework, is developed to address both methodological challenges and uncertainties in transportation sustainability research. The proposed approach provides a more comprehensive, system-based sustainability assessment framework by capturing the dynamic relations among the parameters within the U.S. transportation system as a whole with respect to its environmental, social, and economic impacts. Using multivariate uncertainty analysis, likelihood of the impact reduction potentials of different vehicle types, as well as the behavioral limits of the sustainability potentials of each vehicle type are analyzed. Seven sustainability impact categories are dynamically quantified for four different vehicle types (internal combustion, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles) from 2015 to 2050. Although impacts of electric vehicles have the largest uncertainty, they are expected (90% confidence) to be the best alternative in long-term for reducing human health impacts and air pollution from transportation. While results based on deterministic (average) values indicate that electric vehicles have greater potential of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, plug-in hybrid vehicles have the largest potential according to the results with 90% confidence interval. © 2016","Electric vehicles; Life cycle sustainability assessment; Policy making; Sustainable transportation; System dynamics; Uncertainty","Battery electric vehicles; Crashworthiness; Economic and social effects; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Life cycle; Multivariant analysis; Petroleum transportation; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Sustainable development; Transportation; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicles; Life cycle sustainability assessments; Policy making; Sustainable transportation; System Dynamics; Uncertainty; atmospheric pollution; electric vehicle; emission inventory; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; health impact; life cycle; policy making; reduction; research method; socioeconomic impact; sustainability; traffic emission; transportation system; uncertainty analysis; Environmental impact","U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT; University of Central Florida, UCF, (DTRT13-G-UTC51)","This work was supported in part by an award to the University of Central Florida as part of grant number DTRT13-G-UTC51 from the US Department of Transportation's University Transportation Centers Program.

However, outcomes depend heavily on the electricity generation process, power plant locations, and vehicle use decisions. This paper provides a clear methodology for predicting PEV emissions impacts by anticipating battery-charging decisions and power plant energy sources across Texas. Life-cycle impacts of vehicle production and use and Texans' exposure to emissions are also computed and monetized. This study reveals to what extent PEVs are more environmentally friendly, for most pollutant species, than conventional passenger cars in Texas, after recognizing the emissions and energy impacts of battery provision and other manufacturing processes. Results indicate that PEVs on today's grid can reduce GHGs, NOx, PM10, and CO in urban areas, but generate significantly higher emissions of SO2 than existing light-duty vehicles. Use of coal for electricity production is a primary concern for PEV growth, but the energy security benefits of electrified vehicle-miles endure. As conventional vehicle emissions rates improve, it appears that power grids must follow suit (by improving emissions technologies and/or shifting toward cleaner generation sources) to compete on an emissions-monetized basis with conventional vehicles in many locations. Moreover, while PEV pollution impacts may shift to more remote (power plant) locations, dense urban populations remain most strongly affected by local power plant emissions in many Texas locations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Air quality; Electrification of miles traveled; Greenhouse gas emissions; Human exposure; Plug-in electric vehicles","Texas; United States; Air quality; Electric batteries; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Location; Pollution; Sulfur dioxide; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Electrification of miles traveled; Electrified vehicles; Human exposures; Manufacturing process; Plug-in Electric Vehicles; Power-plant emissions; air quality; electric vehicle; electrification; emission inventory; energy resource; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; planning method; urban area; Secondary batteries","EV-TEC; National Science Foundation, NSF; Texas A and M University, TAMU; University of Texas at Austin","This project was funded by the Electric Vehicle Transportation and Electricity Convergence (EV-TEC) Center , a joint research program between the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, the National Science Foundation, and numerous corporate and governmental agencies.

In this study, in order to minimize charging cost of the plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), conventional grid-supplied PEVs parking lots are proposed to be canopied with PV panels, since parking lots occupy a considerable surface of a city. Also, the solar parking lots can cool down PEVs, charge their batteries, and even deliver excess energy to the grid. In this paper, value of the net benefit due to equipping a solar parking lot with PV panels are investigated over the life time of the PV panels with and without presence an energy storage. Herein, the cost and income terms include investment cost for purchasing the PV panels, investment cost for purchasing a battery, and benefit due to charging the PEVs with free energy generated by the PV panels. Moreover, the problem is simulated from different staring years considering the real prices of the PV panels and battery. In addition, the cost-to-benefit transition year is determined in every simulation. © 2016 IEEE.","Energy storage; photovoltaic (PV) panels; plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs); solar parking lot","Charging (batteries); Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric network analysis; Electric network parameters; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Energy resources; Energy security; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Free energy; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Vehicles; Electrical distribution system; Environmental issues; Excess energy; Investment costs; Life-times; Parking lots; Photovoltaic panels; PV panel; Plug-in electric vehicles","","","M.

Yet, global energy consumption, even at present levels, has already given rise to major concerns over the security of future supplies, together with the attendant twin problems of environmental degradation and climate change. Accordingly, countries are examining a whole range of new policies and technology issues to make their energy futures 'sustainable', that is, to maintain economic growth and cultural values whilst providing energy security and environmental protection. A step in the right direction is to place electrochemical power sources-serviceable, efficient and clean technology-at the cutting edge of energy strategies, regardless of the relatively low price of such traditional fuels as coal, mineral oil and natural gas. Following a chronicle of the events that led up to the discovery of batteries and fuel cells, the paper discusses the application of these devices as important technology for shifting primary energy demand away from fossil fuels and towards renewable sources that are more abundant, less expensive and/or more environmentally benign. Finally, consideration is given to the idea of introducing hydrogen as the universal vector for conveying renewable forms of energy and also as the ultimate non-polluting fuel. Fuel cells are the key enabling technology for a hydrogen economy.

The technology advances in power electronics and energy storage technologies promises to bring plug-in electric vehicles (both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) into the commercial domain. Many vehicle manufacturers have planned to introduce their vehicles in the market within the next 3 years. However, charging of plug-in electric vehicles can potentially increase peak power demand on power distribution network, and may have impact on various grid assets including thermal loading, voltage, unbalance, losses etc. In order to estimate the potential impacts, we must estimate the additional power demands and its temporal variations due to charging of plug-in electric vehicles. A scenario-based analysis of the impact on the electric power grid has been taken, with Delhi as a case example case. It includes an estimation of the projected growth in number of vehicles, share of battery operated and plug-in hybrid vehicles among the various modes of transport. The impact on the electric power demand will depend significantly on the charging pattern of the vehicles. Both the options of charging from normal (household) ac power outlets, and the dedicated fast charging stations have been considered. It is desirable that charging of vehicles happen in such a way that the effects on the peak demand on the electric power grid is minimized. Since the use of off-peak power for charging of electric vehicles helps in minimizing the impact on the grid, management of vehicle charging will assume significance as level of penetration increases. New concepts like smart charging may gain focus in such context.

Emerging regulation has raised urgent questions about both definition and evaluation of life-cycle emissions, and the effectiveness, efficiency and equity of regulatory approaches which use such analyses. This paper focuses on the LCA for transportation fuels from unconventional hydrocarbon sources and associated regulatory issues and implications, and examines these in the context of experience gained in the study of conventional hydrocarbon sources, biofuels, electric vehicles, and other alternatives. Critical issues arise in the regulatory use of life-cycle emissions analysis when comparing different types of fuels, for different types of vehicles, including: • Uncertainty in life-cycle emissions - Differences in estimates of the life-cycle emissions for one fuel can exceed the differences in estimates for different fuels; boundaries, accounting, aggregation and accuracy of LCA are each critical and determining issues in its application in regulations. • Flexible pathways - In order to incentivize innovation in fuel production, many pathways (with the ability to be altered) are needed to map production from each individual agent, who will each have their own process. • Energy security - Regulation to lower the life-cycle emissions is often also intended to improve energy security (e.g. by increasing supplies of indigenous biofuels); however, in the case of unconventional sources of oil such regulations may aggravate energy security. For complex policies, such as those involving LCA - especially where there are international ramifications - much broader dialogue is needed to improve the policy's effectiveness, efficiency and ultimately credibility.

For now and the foreseeable future, batteries remain the most promising electrical energy storage systems for many applications, from portable electronics to emerging technologies such as electric vehicles and smart grids, by potentially offering significantly improved performance, energy efficiencies, reliability, and energy security while also permitting a drastic reduction in fuel consumption and emissions. The energy and power storage characteristics of batteries critically impact the commercial viability of these emerging technologies. For example, the realization of electric vehicles hinges on the availability of batteries with significantly improved energy and power density, durability, and reduced cost. Further, the design, performance, portability, and innovation of many portable electronics are limited severely by the size, power, and cycle life of the existing batteries. Creation of nanostructured electrode materials represents one of the most attractive strategies to dramatically enhance battery performance, including capacity, rate capability, cycling life, and safety.

Of all respondents, 28% lack an understanding of hybrid powertrain technology. More than 40% are uninformed about EVs. The rising price of fuel is the main factor driving EV interest, with concerns about energy security and climate change growing in importance. A 10+% core of possible EV early adopters has formed. Among the largest concerns in purchasing an EV are vehicle cost and driving and battery range, although most consumers do not need to cover long distances regularly. The majority of consumers are not willing to compromise vehicle capabilities when considering the purchase of an EV. Of the 1,000 survey participants: • 91% drive less than 50 miles a day. • 86% paid less than $35,000 for their vehicle. • 72% drive less than 30 miles a day. • 4% paid more than $45,000 for their vehicle • 2% drive more than 100 miles a day. • 28% of all respondents lack an understanding of hybrid powertrain technology. More than 40% are uninformed about EVs. The majority of respondents would prefer purchasing an EV over leasing. Although 72% of respondents drive less than 30 miles per weekday, 87% of respondents expect EVs to have a daily driving range of 50 to 200 miles. Of the respondents, 34% are willing to help pay for charging stations to be installed in their communities.

These technologies offer several potential benefits, including energy security, utilization of EV batteries as load-balancing devices in electricity grids, and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The authors have developed an integrated framework for assessing these opportunities, through a sequence of models describing patterns of vehicle usage and battery recharge. The approach is disaggregated both in space and in time, in order to provide a sound operational basis for impact assessment. The relevant patterns of vehicle usage are concerned with distance travelled during off-driveway periods (ODPs), and ODP departure and arrival times. In the modelling approach developed by the authors, these patterns are derived from travel surveys carried out by state Government agencies, where survey data is available; elsewhere, they are approximated using information from comparable areas. The vehicle usage estimates are combined with estimates of the projected number of EVs in each Statistical Local Area to obtain profiles of total charging energy, which in turn are utilized by a suite of algorithms that model battery recharge/discharge processes. The processes modelled by these algorithms include peak and off-peak charging, and off-peak charging combined with vehicle-to-house discharging to support the grid at times of peak electricity consumption.

This work ascertains the acquisition, disposal, and use patterns of personal vehicles of a synthetic population over time and relies on microsimulation to anticipate fleet composition, usage, and greenhouse gas emissions under different settings. Twenty-five-year simulations predict the highest market share for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), hybrid electric vehicles, and smart cars and the greatest reductions in carbon emissions under an increased gasoline price ($7/gal). Results under a ""feebate"" policy scenario (where fees apply to low-fuel-economy vehicles, and rebates rise with fuel economies above a threshold) indicated a shift toward fuel-efficient vehicles but with vehicle miles traveled (VMT) rising, thanks to lower driving costs. Excepting the low PHEV price and feebate policy simulations, all other scenarios predicted a lower fleet VMT value. The high-density scenario (job and household densities quadrupled) resulted in the lowest vehicle ownership levels and lower VMT values and emissions. The low-PHEV-price scenario resulted in higher shares of PHEVs but negligible impacts from greenhouse gas emissions. Adoption and widespread use of plug-in vehicles will depend on marketing, competitive pricing, government incentives, reliable driving-range reports, and charging infrastructure. Though just 29% of survey respondents stated support for a (specific) feebate policy, 35% indicated an interest in purchasing a PHEV if it cost just $6,000 more than its gasoline counterpart.","","Competition; Costs; Economics; Electric vehicles; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Surveys; Carbon emissions; Competitive pricing; Energy security; Fleet composition; Fuel-efficient vehicles; Gasoline prices; Government incentive; High-density; Hybrid electric vehicle; Light-duty vehicle fleet; Market share; Microsimulation; Personal vehicles; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Plug-ins; Policy scenario; Policy simulation; Smart car; Synthetic populations; Usage patterns; Vehicle ownership; Vehicle-miles traveled; Fleet operations","","","K.M.

Plug in hybrid Vehicle (PHV) uses electric energy from grid rather than fuel for most short trips and therefore presents a next step forward towards an even more effective solution for these concerns. For longer trips, the PHV works as a conventional hybrid vehicle, providing all the benefits of Toyota full hybrid technology, such as low fuel consumption, user-friendliness and long cruising range. This paper describes a newly developed plug-in hybrid system and its vehicle performance. This system uses a Li-ion battery with high energy density and has an EV-range within usual trip length without sacrificing cabin space. The vehicle achieves a CO2 emission of 59g/km, which corresponds to a fuel consumption of 2.6 liter/100 km, and meets the most stringent emission regulations in the world. The new PHV, which was developed for conducting a large scale demonstration worldwide with about 600 units, is a forerunner of the large-scale mass production of PHV in early 2012. PHVs have the potential to become popular as a realistic solution towards sustainable mobility by renewable electricity usage in the future.

Grid-enabled passenger vehicles, like electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) can help address environmental and energy issues. Automakers have recognized that electric drive vehicles are critical to the future of the industry. However, some challenges exist to greater adoption: the perception of cost, EV range, access to charging, potential impacts to the grid, and lack of public awareness about the availability and practicality of these vehicles. Although the current initial price for EV's is higher, their operating costs are lower. Policies that reduce the total cost of ownership of EVs and PHEVs, compared to conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, will lead to faster market penetration. Greater access to charging infrastructure will also accelerate public adoption. Smart grid technology will optimize the vehicle integration with the grid, allowing intelligent and efficient use of energy. By coordinating efforts and using a systems perspective, the advantages of EVs and PHEVs can be achieved using the least resources. This paper analyzes these factors, their rate of acceleration and how they may synergistically align for the electrification of vehicles. © 2011 IEEE.","Batteries; climate change; electric vehicle charging infrastructure; road vehicle electric propulsion","Charging (batteries); Climate change; Costs; Electric drives; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Internal combustion engines; Operating costs; Smart power grids; Solar cells; Charging infrastructures; Electric vehicle charging infrastructures; Electric-drive vehicles; Environment and energies; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Road vehicle electric propulsion; Total cost of ownership; Vehicle electrifications; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","NFPA; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; U.S. Department of Homeland Security, DHS; Fire Protection Research Foundation, FPRF","The US is prepared for the EV national roll out with comprehensive safety plans with National Fire Protection Association’s (NFPA) emergency responder safety training program for advance electric drive vehicles.

The country has been challenged with power shortages in the short-term and faces complex energy security decisions in the long-term. Japan has a long history of implementing energy conservation policies, such as the Top Runner Program, which covers 23 products including appliances and industrial equipment. However, Japan's efficiency policy for polyphase electric motors is considered below international standards. Polyphase electric motors accounted for about 55% of the nation's total power consumption in 2008. The aim of this study is to estimate potential energy savings and reduction in CO2 emissions (2014-2043) by examining scenarios involving adopting two different polyphase motor efficiency standards and comparing them to a base case and concludes by suggesting pathways for further policy development using the results obtained. The study finds that if level IE2 of the international efficiency standard IEC 60034-30 were implemented, it would save 8.3TWh (or 0.03 quads) per year, which is equivalent to about 0.8% of Japan's total electric power consumption in 2010. If level IE3 of the IEC 60034-30 were implemented instead, it would save about 13.3TWh (or 0.05 quads) per year. The corresponding cumulative energy savings and reduction in CO2 emissions for the IE2 scenario would be 249TWh (or 0.85 quads) and 93Mt. The corresponding cumulative energy savings and reduction in CO2 emissions for the IE3 scenario would be 398TWh (or 1.36 quads) and 149Mt. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy efficiency; Japan; Polyphase electric motors","Japan; Electric motors; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Nuclear power plants; Potential energy; Standards; Complex energy; Cumulative energy; Efficiency standards; Electric power consumption; Energy conservation policy; Higher efficiency; Industrial equipment; International standards; Japan; Motor efficiencies; Policy development; Power shortage; Total power consumption; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; energy policy; nuclear power plant; policy development; Carbon dioxide","CEMEP; European Committee of Manufacturers of Electrical Machines and Power Electronics; European Commission","In 1998, a voluntary agreement supported by European Committee of Manufacturers of Electrical Machines and Power Electronics (CEMEP) and the European Commission was established and signed by 36 motor manufacturers, representing 80% of the European production of standard motors.

This paper addresses that gap by presenting a scenario exercise using an integrated suite of sectoral and whole systems models to explore potential energy pathways in the UK transport sector. Techno-economic driven scenarios are contrasted with one in which social change is strongly influenced by concerns about energy use, the environment and well-being. The 'what if' Lifestyle scenario reveals a future in which distance travelled by car is reduced by 74% by 2050 and final energy demand from transport is halved compared to the reference case. Despite the more rapid uptake of electric vehicles and the larger share of electricity in final energy demand, it shows a future where electricity decarbonisation could be delayed. The paper illustrates the key trade-off between the more aggressive pursuit of purely technological fixes and demand reduction in the transport sector and concludes there are strong arguments for pursuing both demand and supply side solutions in the pursuit of emissions reduction and energy security. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Lifestyles; Socio-technical scenarios; Transport energy modelling","United Kingdom; Automobile exhibitions; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy utilization; Demand and supply; Demand reduction; Emissions reduction; Energy demands; Energy security; Energy use; Final energy; Lifestyles; Social changes; Socio-technical approach; Sociocultural factors; Sociotechnical; Systems models; Technical efficiency; Techno-economics; Transport energy; Transport sectors; demand analysis; electric vehicle; electricity generation; electricity supply; emission control; energy efficiency; energy planning; environmental economics; future prospect; lifestyle; modeling; social change; transportation system; Energy efficiency","Research Councils UK, RCUK","This research was funded by the UK Research Councils (Grant no.

There are two major options of energy storage systems in electric vehicles (EVs), which include one where the storage of electrical energy is done by using batteries and the other where the storage of energy is in the form of hydrogen. The Volt is an EV equipped with an additional gasoline engine that is used to extend the vehicle range beyond the electric range when required (E-REV). The main energy storage in the Volt is a Li-ion battery with a nominal energy content of 16 kWh and a pure battery-electric range of 60 km. This leads to reduced fuel consumption, reduced emissions, and also to increased energy security via geographic diversification of the available energy sources. The ultimate objective of the GM strategy is to produce zero-emission vehicles that use an electric powertrain system based on hydrogen fuel cells or purely battery-electric systems and that are also fully competitive to conventional vehicles with regards to performance and ease-of-use. E-REVs such as the Chevrolet Volt or the Opel Ampera are perfectly suited for people who may have to cover longer ranges of up to 500 km and for those who are willing to accept a small ICE in order to ensure the range beyond the initial 60 km of pure EV operation. On the other hand, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are always operated as zero-emission vehicles that can be refueled within 3-5 min, and offer a long range of about 500 km at full performance, even for family-sized cars. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

EVs link two major infrastructures, the transportation and the electric power grid. This provides a chance to bring other sources of energy into transportation, displace petroleum and, with the right mix of power generation sources, reduce CO2 emissions. The main obstacles for introducing a large numbers of EVs are cost, battery weight, and vehicle range. Battery health is also a factor, both directly and indirectly, by introducing limits on depth of discharge. This paper considers a low-cost path for extending the range of a small urban EV by integrating a parallel hydraulic system for harvesting and reusing braking energy. The idea behind the concept is to avoid replacement of lead-acid or small Li-Ion batteries with a very expensive Li-Ion pack, and instead use a low-cost hydraulic system to achieve comparable range improvements. A Matlab/SIMULINK model was developed to simulate a baseline EV truck with a series wound DC motor and lead-acid batteries. The simulation was validated with tests at the US EPA National Vehicle and Fuel Efficiency Lab. Subsequently, the hydraulic pump/motor and accumulator models were integrated to create an EV-Hydraulic Hybrid and the simulation was used to explore tradeoffs related to improving battery health, reducing the overall energy demand, and increasing the range. Preliminary strategy was focused on maximizing the driving range, but insight obtained through the analysis of interactions in the system enabled refinements that significantly benefit battery health without compromising electric range. © 2011 SAE International.","","Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Computer simulation; DC motors; DC power transmission; Electric discharges; Electric vehicles; Energy harvesting; Energy management; Engineering exhibitions; Health; Hydraulic accumulators; Hydraulic equipment; Hydraulics; Petroleum transportation; Accumulator model; Battery health; Braking energy; Depth of discharges; Driving range; Electric power grids; Electric range; Energy demands; Energy security; Fuel efficiency; Hydraulic pump; Hydraulic system; Li-ion batteries; Management options; MATLAB /simulink; Power generation sources; Regeneration system; Sources of energy; Energy efficiency","","","Z.S.

To address the energy security and urban air-pollution concerns that emerge from rapid vehicle population growth, China has initiated the Thousands of Vehicles, Tens of Cities (TVTC) Program to accelerate the new energy vehicle (NEV) commercialization. In this paper, we summarize the efforts made by the Chinese government since 1995 in the areas of research and development, demonstration, and communalization of NEVs; evaluate the progress of NEV demonstration; and provide some recommendations for future development. Our analysis has determined that the deployment of NEVs for the TVTC Program is lagging behind the original plan and, on average, only 26-36% of the goals have been attained by October 2011. Although China has approved many NEV models for sale, significantly more than 50% of them are not in production. On the other hand, stimulated by the policy shift, electric vehicle production has increased considerably, thereby contributing 23% and 44% of the total NEV production in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Additionally, because of the constraints imposed by price and technology maturity, lead-acid battery technology is a substantial factor in the high-volume sales of top NEV car models. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

In 2006, the State Council adopted the China Science and Technology Medium-and Long-Term Development Plan, which for the first time mentioned the NEV term in the official policies and specified focusing on hybrid vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles (the State Council 2006). At the same time, MOST continued its support of the NEV and initiated the Energy Savings and New Energy Vehicle Key Project under the 863 Program (MOST 2006a, b). During the 11th FYP, the total funding, including both national and local governments and private sectors, exceeded $1.5 billion (Fig. 4). The Management Rule on New Energy Vehicle Production, adopted by the NDRC in 2007, officially defined the term, NEV, for the first time. Based on the definition, NEVs include HEVs, BEVs (including solar-panel-powered vehicles), FCVs, hydrogen internal-combustion engine vehicles, and other vehicles with new fuels, such as di-methyl ether and high-efficient energy storage capacitors (NDRC 2007).; Funding text 3: In the past 10 years, China has invested a significant amount of funding to develop and commercialize NEVs. However, project monitoring and evaluation is lagging behind. This has been demonstrated from our research for this paper. We have attempted many ways to collect the most updated and reliable data from different sources in order to determine the status of the Chinese NEV program. However, there is no single source for such information. Data about NEV makers and models since 2009 have been obtained from the recommended NEV product bulletins released by the government. Makers and models before that time are based on information from the Energy Savings and New Energy Vehicle Yearbook (CAT-ARC 2010), which is edited by the China Automotive Technology & Research Center (CATARC) and guided by the Technical Experts Committee for Energy Savings and NEV Key Project under the MOST 863 Program. The NEV demonstration goals for individual participating cities are from government documents and policies. The production volume is from both the Yearbook and the website sponsored by the Clean Vehicle Production Promotion Center, Energy Savings and NEV Key Project Office under the 863 Program, and CATARC. Vehicle population data have been gathered from government documents, workshops sponsored by the governments, government official websites, key media coverage, and surveys to local cities. Even with such efforts, the NEV population data have limits. Among the 25 cities, 5 cities had NEV population data by 2010, 5 cities had the data by March or April of 2011, and 15 cities had the data by July to October 2011.","H.

These alternative vehicles include different fuels and electrification. The ultimate for on-road CO2 reductions is a zero emission vehicle, which can be achieved by either a hydrogen fuel cell or battery electric vehicle. These vehicles would also require a renewable energy source to provide their propulsion energy in order to achieve maximum sustainability for both CO2 reduction and energy security. Renewable energy sources such as wind or solar result in heat or electricity that needs to be generated into an energy carrier such as hydrogen or stored in a battery. When examining these options based strictly on the efficiency path, previous analysis have concluded fuel cell vehicles may not be an appropriate suitability strategy in comparison to battery electric vehicles. However, the viability of an alternative vehicle requires a comprehensive assessment of the various vehicle parameters that affect the customer satisfaction. In particular, this paper examines the renewable energy consumption, range, and cost for hydrogen fuel cell and battery electric vehicles. In particular, these conflicting attributes are examined using an objective Pareto frontier analysis to evaluate the trade-offs and trends that should be considered when developing a sustainability strategy.

We need to supply all energy, not just electricity, from diverse renewable energy (RE) resources, both distributed and centralized, where the world's richest RE resources - of large geographic extent and high intensity - are stranded: far from end-users with inadequate or nonexistent gathering and transmission systems to deliver the energy. Electricity energy storage cannot affordably firm large, intermittent renewables at annual scale, while carbon-free gaseous hydrogen (GH2) and liquid anhydrous ammonia (NH3) fuels can, at < US$ 1.00 / kWh capital cost: GH2 in large solution-mined salt caverns, NH3 in surface tanks, both pressurized and refrigerated. Energy content of these fuels: 1 kg GH2 = 39.4 kWh (HHV) or 33.3 kWh (LHV) 1 kg NH3 = 6.3 kWh (HHV) or 5.2 kWh (LHV) Higher heating value (HHV) and lower heating value (LHV) of fuels differ by the heat of vaporization of water. We need to conceive, analyze, strategize, snd commit to building complete RE systems, from photons and moving air and water molecules to firm and dispatchable energy services delivered to distant end-users. Natural gas energy systems may be a better model than a ""smarter"" electricity grid. ""Smart Grid"" is emerging as primarily a DSM (demand side management) strategy to encourage energy conservation. Making the electricity grid ""smarter"" does not: 1. Increase physical transmission capacity; 2. Provide affordable annual-scale firming storage for RE; 3. Solve grid integration problem for large, time-varying RE; 4. Alleviate ""not in my back yard"" (NIMBY) objections to new transmission siting; 5. Reduce the high O&M costs of overhead electric lines. The ""smarter"" grid may be more vulnerable to cyberattack than today's grid. Adding storage, control, and power quality adjunct devices to the electricity grid, to accommodate very high RE content, may be technically and economically inferior to the GH2 and NH3 RE systems discussed here. Thus, we need to look beyond ""smart grid"", expanding our concept of ""transmission"", to synergistically and simultaneously solve the transmission, firming storage, and RE integration ""balancing"" problems now severely constraining our progress toward ""running the world on renewables"". Today's energy industry is very water-intensive, consuming ∼17,000 × 10∧9 liters of fresh water annually in USA. If total USA annual energy - from all sources, for all uses - were generated as RE-source electricity and converted to GH2 and / or NH3 fuels for transmission, total freshwater feedstock consumption, about one-fourth liter per kWh, would be ∼900 × 10∧9 liters per year. This is far less than ∼17,000 × 109 liters the USA energy sector ""consumed"" in 2005. For example, a 1,000 MW windplant, operating at 40% capacity factor (CF), producing ∼3,500 TWh (TWh = 109 kWh) per year, would consume ∼800 × 10∧6 liters of freshwater feedstock per year. Transportation electrification does not necessarily require battery electric vehicles (BEV's). GH2 and / or NH3 fuels would supply electric energy to the drive system via fuel cells, and may provide longer range at lower cost, greater energy security, and with better access to large, stranded, RE resources as annually-firm energy than an expanded and ""smarter"" electricity grid could provide. The energy industry now needs to conceive, design, bid, build, and operate pilot plants by which to discover and demonstrate the technical and economic advantages - if any - of RE-source GH2 and / or NH3 fuel transmission, storage, and delivery systems, as humanity urgently proceeds to ""run the world on renewables"".","","","","","","","","07365721","978-162276385-6","PGRCD","","English","Int.

In markets where introduction of these vehicles has been met with supportive policies, their demand has been relatively strong. However in Australia, due mainly to a lack of policy and industry support, a much smaller number of these vehicles have been available, resulting in markedly lower market penetration. While it has been asserted that the increased upfront cost of plugin vehicles diminishes the ""value proposition"" to consumers who might otherwise be customers, early investigation of consumer attitudes toward these products in Australia indicate that there may be other factors at play. Through a literature review of the existing marketplace for plug-in vehicles, and supported by preliminary findings from survey data collected at a public community test drive event called Green Zone Drive and held at the Gold Coast, Queensland in August 2012, this paper examines a variety of factors thought to influence motorists' impressions of modern clean vehicles and subsequent demand for these products. In addition to inherent vehicle feature preferences, factors stated by respondents to influence their opinions of these vehicles included the policy environment, social networks, media influence, and the car-buying experience. In this study early impressions from a small sample of first time clean vehicle Australian motorists shed light on consumer attitudes and misunderstandings of clean vehicle product offerings and will help to direct future research with a view to improve the marketability of these vehicles.","","Automobile drivers; Commerce; Digital storage; Energy policy; Energy security; Vehicles; Consumer attitudes; Literature reviews; Market penetration; Product offerings; Public communities; Renewable energies; Supportive policies; Value proposition; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","","","","","Australasian Transport Research Forum","","","","","English","Austr.

However, the output voltage of this TE-PV hybrid energy system is governed by the voltage of the battery, which is affected by the state of charge of the battery and the charging/discharging current. Furthermore, in order to improve the power density and life cycle of the battery, the ultracapacitor (UC) has been proposed to hybridize with the battery to form a hybrid energy storage system. In this paper, a multi-hybrid energy system is proposed for HEVs, which incorporates the advantages of the TE-PV hybrid subsystem and the ultracapacitor-battery (UC-B) hybrid subsystem. On the one side, the TE-PV hybrid subsystem can provide the higher fuel economy due to the increase of onboard renewable energy, the better energy security due to the use of multiple energy sources, and the higher control flexibility due to the coordination for charging the same pack of batteries. On the other side, the UC-B hybrid subsystem can provide faster transient power, higher power density and longer battery lifetime.

Although the role of V2G technology within the context of optimal scheduling for larger grids has received much attention in the literature, its role within the regulation of microgrids has not yet been studied extensively. In this paper, we focus on the voltage and frequency regulation problem. We develop a microgrid model that is representative of the microgrid architecture considered in the SPIDERS (Smart Power Infrastructure Demonstration for Energy Reliability and Security) project of the Department of Defense. The model is parameterized to reflect the characteristics of Camp Smith, HI, the targeted installation of the SPIDERS project, and the long term Army goals regarding renewable energy penetration and reduction in fuel consumption. The model is augmented by power, frequency, and voltage control algorithms for the inverters that connect microsources to the microgrid. It also incorporates charging/discharging control algorithms for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to take advantage of their capacity as both controllable loads and sources. Using this model, we study the impact of PEVs on the microgrid at different penetration levels and for different control parameters, with the aim of identifying the conditions needed for the vehicle-to-grid technology to have a positive impact on microgrid performance. © 2011 IEEE.","Electric vehicles; frequency control; microgrid; vehicle-to-grid; voltage control","Algorithms; Electric frequency control; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Voltage control; Charging/discharging; Control parameters; Controllable loads; Department of Defense; Energy security; Frequency regulations; Micro grid; Microgrid architecture; Microsources; Optimal scheduling; Parameterized; Penetration level; Plug-ins; Renewable energies; Smart power; Vehicle to grids; Military vehicles","","","T.

This research attempts to ascertain which factors such as reductions in fuel costs and greenhouse gas emissions, incentives on the purchase price, road tax, and car insurance, could encourage the adoption of electric vehicles instead of conventional ones. This study also attempts to ascertain which aspects of a vehicle guarantee the full satisfaction of customer needs by providing the expected quality. Other questions ask respondents to indicate their favorite electric vehicle, body style and to indicate which fuel consumption is considered efficient for a hybrid vehicle. Finally, this research examines the main barriers to the electric vehicles market introduction. Design/methodology/approach To examine and to understand customers' perceptions about electric vehicles, an empirical investigation was carried out. Data collection was based on an empirical investigation through a survey. 600 paper copies of a questionnaire were delivered to potential Italian car customers (in possession of a car or intentioned to purchase one) in 2012, from May to October. Further questionnaires were collected by an online-survey. After receiving the questionnaires back from the respondents, a statistical analysis was carried out to provide an overview of the main barriers considered when considering an electric vehicle and of the most important attributes of a motor vehicle. Three important categories of attributes for the surveyed customers were evaluated: economic, qualitative/technical and environmental/practical. These categories were obtained by an analysis of 22 factors. Originality/value Focus on customer satisfaction is an important goal in business practice. Against this background, our research has several implications for companies operating in the automotive industry. This paper provides information on the orientations and perceptions of passenger car enthusiasts and identifies potential socio-technical-economic barriers to the adoption of electric vehicles. It also determines if sustainability issues influence consumer decisions when purchasing an EV. The results of this study can provide a guide to the decisions of the engineers during the design phase to incorporate consumer preferences and then ensure the quality that customers expect from the product. The results are also useful for policy makers, who may use media and social networks to influence the appreciation of potential buyers for non-financial benefits such as energy security and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.","Automobile demand; Electric vehicles; Italian road transport; Sustainable transportation; Vehicles quality aspects","","","","","","AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professors","22838996","","","","English","Proc.

Toyota began sales of the Prius Plug-in Hybrid in early 2012 in both the U.S. and Japan. This is the first PHV to be mass-produced by Toyota Motor Corporation. Prior to this, in December 2009, Toyota sold 650 PHVs through lease programs for verification testing in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Toyota has developed a new battery pack system for the mass-produced PHV. The system of the recently launched mass-produced vehicle underwent major improvements in response to the results of this verification testing. As a result of newly developed high-capacity battery cells and a lightweight aluminum frame structure, this system is approximately 50% lighter and 50% smaller in volume terms than the system in the verification vehicles. This paper discusses the development of the new battery pack and system for this mass-produced PHV.","Battery; Lithium battery; PHEV (plug in hybrid electric vehicle)","Aluminum; Carbon dioxide; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Industry; Lithium batteries; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Air pollutants; Aluminum frames; Battery; Battery cells; Battery pack; Energy security; Energy source; High-capacity; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Plug-in hybrids; Toyota motor corporations; Urban areas; Verification testing; Phev (plugin hybrid electric vehicle); Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Lithium batteries","","","","","","","978-162276421-1","","","English","Electr.

However, the output voltage of this TE-PV hybrid energy system is governed by the voltage of the battery, which is affected by the state of charge of the battery and the charging/discharging current. Furthermore, in order to improve the power density and life cycle of the battery, the ultracapacitor (UC) has been proposed to hybridize with the battery to form a hybrid energy storage system. In this paper, a multi-hybrid energy system is proposed for HEVs, which incorporates the advantages of the TE-PV hybrid subsystem and the ultracapacitor-battery (UC-B) hybrid subsystem. On the one side, the TE-PV hybrid subsystem can provide the higher fuel economy due to the increase of on-board renewable energy, the better energy security due to the use of multiple energy sources, and the higher control flexibility due to the coordination for charging the same pack of batteries.

Many governments are interested in promoting hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and other alternatives to conventional internal combustion engines because of concerns about energy security, oil dependence, air pollution, and global climate change. HEVs achieve greater fuel efficiency than conventional vehicles, although the extent of improvement in efficiency depends greatly on the specific configuration of the HEV system. The development of HEVs in three major markets - Japan, the United States, and China - was characterized by similar drivers of innovation. However, policy mechanisms and incentives for deployment diverged significantly. In all three countries, governments originally pushed harder for alternative automotive technologies other than hybrids, such as pure electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. In some cases, private firms made research and development (R&D) choices that do not appear to have been strongly influenced by public policy but rather followed a commercial logic in exploring fuel-efficient technologies. In other cases, government policies appear to actually have turned firms away from HEVs. Once HEVs emerged in the marketplace, however, the government response was completely different in each of the three countries, especially in terms of the extent to which each government was prepared to support HEVs‘ transition through the early deployment phase to facilitate widespread market diffusion. © International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis 2014.","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","978-113915088-0; 978-110702322-2","","","English","Energy Technology Innovation: Learning from Historical Successes and Failures","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928640357"

Overall natural gas contributes over 40% of the UK primary energy consumption, and oil around 33%. Total UK gas demand is of the order of 100bcm of gas. If we were able to replace all of UK transport energy consumption directly with natural gas we would require of the order of 70bcm of gas per annum. There are suggestions that conversion to a full electric transport infrastructure is a realistic energy scenario. However, as the total energy demand from road transport is comparable to that which is currently supplied as natural gas to the UK and it also equates to over twice the amount of energy currently being transported through the UK national electricity grid, there are issues regarding the feasibility of such an approach. Natural gas vehicles (NGVs) are a rapidly developing market worldwide, with currently over 12 million vehicles on the road and around 20-30% per annum growth. Contributory factors to their uptake have included emissions reduction, energy security concerns and availability of indigenous resources. Many countries therefore incentivise NGV uptake through fuel prices, tax breaks or subsidies of various sorts. A new range of vehicles is appearing on the road using new technology, and able to easily meet stringent EPA and CARB Standards. HGV, fleet and larger vehicles are particularly benefiting with an expanding infrastructure developing to meet demand. New dual fuel diesel technology and LNG availability is encouraging uptake by hauliers, where payback can be as little as two years. A smaller industry with a number of enthusiastic pioneers is beginning to emerge in the UK on the back of biomethane production and the promise of benefits from the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation and the Renewable Heat Incentive, two UK government support measures aimed at increasing the use of renewable energy. Lifecycle emissions analysis shows that CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions from NGVs can compare with the best evolved alternative technologies. New technologies are emerging which reduce tailpipe methane emissions. The emergence of CNG hybrids and the increasing importance of biomethane further improve the carbon reduction potential. A high level analysis of infrastructure investment costs indicate that per tonne of carbon saved, NGVs can give a significantly better return (compared to electric vehicles). Large vehicles appear best in this regard, but as technologies advance and biomethane becomes more available, all types of vehicles could benefit. In that trucks are likely to be less amenable to electric vehicle penetration, it is suggested that a realistic scenario would develop a fuelling infrastructure which could target 50% or more of trucks and fleets in the long term, requiring a gas load of up to 20bcm and therefore supporting the use and maintenance of the natural gas distribution infrastructure. Through a development roadmap this would also be the best way to support a future fuel cell car infrastructure using local methane steam reforming. With biomethane it would also enable the development of a future DCHP and energy hub infrastructure which could be carbon negative if small scale CO2 sequestration develops. This paper looks at the technology options which can be used to ensure that natural gas vehicles participate in the path to a future low-carbon infrastructure. These include: • Establishing a fuelling infrastructure for CNG around the existing gas distribution network • Establishing a low pressure infrastructure to support a new fleet of low-pressure Adsorbed Natural Gas (ANG) vehicles • Establishing an LNG-based infrastructure benefiting from the available pressure reduction and cold energy at distribution sites.","","","","","","","International Gas Union","","978-162993440-2","","","English","Int.

Widespread adoption of plug-in vehicles would result in significant reductions in CO2 emissions from transportation. It would also reduce our dependence on fossil fuels by replacing petroleum-sourced energy with renewable, domestically produced electricity. While a few OEMs have successfully launched hybrid vehicles and even toyed with plug-in hybrid solutions in the passenger car market segment, little attention has been placed on heavier commercial vehicles. Large utilities operate fleets of several hundred diesel-power trouble trucks to repair and maintain their transmission and distribution infrastructure. Medium-duty segment is over a million vehicles annually. These vehicles are typically driven in densely populated neighborhoods. Idling emissions and noise from Utility service vehicles are disruptive to residential areas and expose operators to diesel exhaust for extended periods. Plug-in Hybrid technology offers a number of advantages to the traditional utility truck. Using stored battery energy, the vehicles can operate extended hours continuous, running the bucket, power tools, lights and accessories while the engine is turned off. In 2006, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and Eaton Corporation partnered in an initiative to develop the first medium duty Diesel plug-in hybrid vehicle, retrofitting a Ford class V F550 trouble truck with Eaton's hybrid power train with a grid-rechargeable 16kWh lithium ion battery. This paper presents the design, development and testing results of this Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle and details the mechanical and electrical integration of the hybrid drive train, high energy batteries and on-board charging system, to provide quiet and emissions-free standby operations and hybrid operation while driving.

This fundamental question is addressed by sketching a sustainable energy strategy that is based predominantly on renewable energy inputs and energy efficiency, with hydrogen playing a crucial and substantial role. But this role is not an exclusive one as in the original concept of the 'hydrogen economy' proposed in the early 1970s. A hierarchy of spatially-distributed hydrogen production, storage and distribution centres relying on local renewable energy sources and feedstocks would be created to avoid the need for an expensive long-distance hydrogen pipeline system. There would thus be complementary use of electricity and hydrogen as energy vectors. Importantly, bulk hydrogen storage would provide the strategic energy reserve to guarantee national and global energy security in a world relying increasingly on renewable energy; and longer-term seasonal storage on electricity grids relying mainly on renewables. In the transport sector, a 'horses for courses' approach is proposed in which hydrogen fuel cell vehicles would be used in road and rail vehicles requiring a range comparable to today's petrol and diesel vehicles, and in coastal and international shipping, while liquid hydrogen would probably have to be used in air transport. Plug-in battery electric vehicles would be reserved for shorter-trips. Energy-economic-environmental modelling is recommended as the next step to quantify the net benefits of the overall strategy outlined. © 2012 The Authors.","Battery vehicles; Energy security; Energy storage; Fuel cell vehicles; Global sustainable energy strategy; Hydrogen economy; Renewable energy","","","","B.

With funding provided by the Electric Power Research Institute1 (EPRI). Eaton Corporation is developing a PHEV platform that can be applied to Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicles. This paper describes the objectives and development activities for the application of the PHEV system 111 a Ford Class 5 F550 based aerial truck.","Architecture; Grid; Hybrid; Plug-in","Air quality; Architecture; Automobiles; Commercial vehicles; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Internal combustion engines; Investments; Electric energy generation; Electric Power Research Institute; Grid; Hybrid; Hybrid-electric vehicles; Plug-ins; Transportation electrifications; Transportation sector; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","","","","","Electric Drive Transportation Association","","","","","English","EVS - Sustainable Mobil.

Should we go electric, ban combustion, move to fuel cells or change to renewable fuels [1-5]? This is an important research question because the number of cars worldwide is predicted to grow from 0.7bn in 2010 to 2bn in 2050, leading to a huge penalty in fossil fuel depletion, climate change and energy security in the near future [6]. But these discussions of electric cars, new battery materials and renewable fuels have missed a key point:- that the main difficulty with cars is their evolution in terms of increasing weight. Evidence shows that cars increase in weight by about 2% per annum. This paper demonstrates that car weight dominates the energy question by showing that Coulomb's law of friction surprisingly applies to a complex system like a car, such that the energy usage, in other words overall friction force, depends mainly on weight. A new theory shows that dissipation in complex systems resolves into Coulomb's Law. Experiments demonstrate that the results fit this theory reasonably well. We have tested a hydrogen fuel cell battery hybrid composite car of 7kN weight and present results better than all existing hydrogen cars in terms of low energy use. The conclusion is that Coulomb's Law can be used to quantify precisely the energy consumption of cars and that lightweight designs are as important as hydrogen electric drive-trains in cutting fuel consumption.","Coulomb friction law; Electric drive train; Fuel cell; Hydrogen","Climate change; Electric drives; Electric vehicles; Friction; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Large scale systems; Battery materials; Coulomb friction law; Coulomb's friction law; Electric drive train; Fossil-fuel depletions; Hybrid composites; Lightweight design; Research questions; Energy utilization","","","","","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","978-184919776-2","","","English","IET Conf Publ","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84894423467"

However finding an optimal battery size is of great importance for the overall economic and environmental performance of the PHEVs. This study investigates the resulting vehicle design, and fleet composition and performance when optimising the PHEV battery with respect to different objective functions possibly reflecting different actors' interest: number of PHEVs, cumulative cost savings and share of electric driving respectively under various assumptions concerning policies and costs. A recently available data set of car movements, containing 445 privately driven Swedish cars that have been measured with GPS-equipment for 1-2 months each is utilized to get a representative car fleet. We find that the battery size and fleet performance are heavily influenced by not only the choice of objective function for the optimization but also by its interaction with the cost structure and performance requirement in the transition from an energy efficient fuel-driven car to a PHEV. The effect of different policies may also vary depending on these conditions and may favour various actors' interests differently. We conclude that these aspects are important to consider both when designing vehicles and when formulating policies for the introduction of PHEVs. © 2013 WEVA Page.","Battery; PHEV; Policy objective; Subsidies","Energy efficiency; Energy security; Environmental management; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Secondary batteries; Vehicle performance; Battery; Economic and environmental performance; Fleet composition; Fleet performance; Objective functions; PHEV; Policy objectives; Subsidies; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","","","","","AVERE","20326653","","","","English","World Electr.

The significant growth of automobile ownership in emerging countries is likely to increase the world oil demand and the associated carbon dioxide emissions. In order to address these energy security and environmental concerns, the deployment of clean energy vehicles, such as EV and PHEV, are expected to play a crucial role due to its high fuel efficiency. On these backgrounds, we develop both global energy system model and world vehicle penetration model, which are able to explicitly analyze the impact of EV introduction into seasonal daily electric load curve considering its specific electricity charging profile to 2050. Simulation results confirm that EV deployment contributes to energy conservation, because oil demand reduction outstrips the growth in its electricity demand and the associated fuel input into power generation mix. Concerning carbon dioxide abatement, the magnitude of the impact relies on the carbon-intensity of power generation mix. If the intensity is low enough to make sure the carbon mitigation effect by EV fuel saving, the emissions reduction is well ensured. It should be noted, however, that, in the regions with high carbon intensity in power generation mix, carbon emissions per mileage of EV is almost equivalent to that of efficient gasoline vehicle like hybrid vehicle and PHEV is slightly higher than hybrid vehicle. © 2012 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.","Electric vehicle; Optimization; Plug-in hybrid vehicle; World energy model; World vehicle penetration model","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy conservation; Fuel economy; Global warming; Land vehicle propulsion; Optimization; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Automobile ownership; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions; Carbon intensity; Carbon mitigation; Clean energy vehicles; Electricity demands; Emissions reduction; Energy security; Environmental characteristic; Environmental concerns; Fuel efficiency; Fuel savings; Gasoline vehicle; Global energy; Global energy system models; Hybrid vehicles; Oil demand; Power generation mix; Vehicle penetration; World energies; World vehicle penetration model; Electric vehicles","","","","","","13488147","","","","Japanese","IEEJ Trans.

As we look to shift away from petroleum-based transportation fuels, most options consume and withdraw more water during their life cycle. Thus, shifting to alternative fuel and energy supplies for transportation will likely increase water use for the transportation sector. Previous work suggests that water consumption for transportation could reach 10% of total U.S. water consumption when meeting the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard mandate at modest irrigation levels for feedstock crops (corn, cellulosic grasses) in combination with other alternative fuels and vehicle technologies (electric vehicles, natural gas vehicles, etc.), but more refined analysis is needed. It is important to understand when and where these new water demands for transportation are anticipated to occur. This paper presents results from simulations of the U.S. 9-region (EPAUS9r) MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) integrated energy systems model for mapping the changes in water withdrawal and consumption during a transition to a low carbon-emitting U.S. transportation fleet. The advantage of using a bottom-up, multi-sector model like MARKAL is the ability to look at consistent scenarios for the full energy system, and endogenously capture interactions between different sectors (e.g. electric power production, biorefineries, and the LDV fleet). MARKAL can simulate a baseline scenario driven by assumptions for biomass feedstock and fossil resource costs and availability, as well as the costs of converting those resources to liquid fuels and electricity. We investigate alternative scenarios both with and without carbon constraints, while varying the pace of vehicle electrification. We compare these scenarios to assess regional differences in water needs as well as aggregate water demand for transportation energy, and how those trade off against greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Our results indicate that the regional water demands and interregional transfers of embodied water could be significant as the light-duty vehicle fleet moves away from petroleum-based fuels, with exports of embodied water on the order of hundreds of billion gallons of water per year for ethanol coming from the Midwest. Interregional transfers of water embodied in electricity may also reach tens of billion gallons of water per year. However, these water requirements will vary substantially based on the light-duty vehicle mix, carbon policy, electric power generation mix, biofuel production levels, and feedstock characteristics. © 2011 by ASME.","","Alternative fuels; Carbon; Economic and social effects; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Energy security; Ethanol fuels; Feedstocks; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Gas fuel analysis; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Life cycle; Natural gas; Natural gas vehicles; Petroleum refining; Petroleum transportation; Water supply; Electric power production; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Integrated energy systems; Light-duty vehicle fleet; Low carbon transportations; Transportation fuels; Transportation sector; Vehicle electrifications; Natural gas transportation","","","","","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)","","978-079185487-7","","","English","ASME Int.

These include improving the electric grid performance, enhancing penetration of renewable energy sources and improving energy security, managing air quality and carbon footprint, creating new markets, and planning energy exchange stations that allow for driver flexibility. Coupling the transportation and power systems through PHEVs presents both challenges and opportunities that involve multidisciplinary approach, and proper policy is necessary to take maximize benefit and avoid pitfalls.

Yet China must first relieve consumer anxieties in order overcome a set of intertwined obstacles and ultimately spur organic electric vehicle market growth. The State has supported the electric vehicle market thus far with investments in battery, motor, and vehicle component innovation as well as with consumer subsidies for select pilot cities. China's new energy vehicle program, 1,000 electric vehicles in 10 cities, instituted in 2009 now encapsulates a total of 25 cities with five cities receiving consumer subsidies. Nevertheless, without a stronger consumer base in the near-term, the momentum for electric vehicle deployment may dissolve. The quandary is if China's policies are sufficient. This study highlights the opportunities and evaluates the policies intended to nullify the challenges of China's potentially burgeoning electric vehicle marketplace.

It is an inevitable option to use photovoltaic effect to directly convert sunlight into electricity. CuIn1-xGaxSe2 (CIGS) thin films were formed from an electrodeposited CuInSe2 (CIS) precursor by thermal processing in vacuum in which the film stoichiometry was adjusted by adding In, Ga and Se. The structure, composition, morphology and opto-electronic properties of the as-deposited and selenized CIS precursors were characterized by various techniques. A 17.2% CIGS based thin film solar cell was developed using the electrodeposited and processed film. The cell structure consisted of Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/MgF2. The cell parameters such as Jsc, Voc, FF and η were determined from I-V characterization of the cell. The solar electric vehicle is made using flexible thin film solar cells. With the solar cell the full charge endurance of SEV can be increased about 35% substantially compared with no solar cells.","Electric vehicle; Flexible; Lightweight; Solar cells; Thin film","Climate change; Electric vehicles; Electrodeposition; Electronic properties; Energy policy; Gallium; Greenhouse gases; Solar cells; Solar energy; Thin films; Flexible; Flexible thin film solar cells; IV characterization; Lightweight; Optoelectronic properties; Renewable energy technologies; Solar electric vehicles; Thin film solar cells; Semiconducting selenium compounds","","","","","Electric Drive Transportation Association","","","","","English","EVS - Sustainable Mobil.

Widespread adoption of plug-in vehicles would result in significant reductions in CO2 emissions from transportation. It would also reduce our dependence on fossil fuels by replacing petroleum-sourced energy with renewable, domestically produced electricity. While a few OEMs have successfully launched hybrid vehicles and even toyed with plug-in hybrid solutions in the passenger car market segment, little attention has been placed on heavier commercial vehicles. Large utilities operate fleets of several hundred diesel-power trouble trucks to repair and maintain their transmission and distribution infrastructure. Medium-duty segment is over a million vehicles annually. These vehicles are typically driven in densely populated neighborhoods. Idling emissions and noise from Utility service vehicles are disruptive to residential areas and expose operators to diesel exhaust for extended periods. Plug-in Hybrid technology offers a number of advantages to the traditional utility truck. Using stored battery energy, the vehicles can operate extended hours continuous, running the bucket, power tools, lights and accessories while the engine is turned off. In 2006, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and Eaton Corporation partnered in an initiative to develop the first medium duty Diesel plug-in hybrid vehicle, retrofitting a Ford class V F550 trouble truck with Eaton's hybrid power train with a grid-rechargeable 16kWh lithium ion battery. This paper presents the design, development and testing results of this Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle and details the mechanical and electrical integration of the hybrid drive train, high energy batteries and on-board charging system, to provide quiet and emissions-free standby operations and hybrid operation while driving. This paper also discuss the benefits and trade-offs of the system architecture, battery sustaining / depleting strategy and estimated impact on the grid.

Reducing energy use in vehicles is key to meeting the forecast increase in demand for transport, while improving energy security and mitigating climate change. Non-powertrain vehicle options may reduce fuel consumption by at least 15%. Electric motors are the significant powertrain option to reduce energy use in vehicles because they are more efficient than the internal combustion engine and can recover a portion of the vehicle kinetic energy during braking. Conventionally, batteries are used to meet both the power and energy demands of electric vehicles and their variants. However, batteries are well-suited to store energy, while ultra-capacitors and high-speed flywheels are better placed to meet the bidirectional, high power requirements of real-world driving. Combining technologies with complementary strengths can yield a lower cost and more efficient energy storage system. While pure and hybrid electric vehicles use less energy than internal combustion engine vehicles, their ability to mitigate climate change is a function of the emissions intensity of the processes used to generate their electricity. © Springer-Verlag London 2012.

Although this is desirable with respect to goals for achieving energy security and environmental improvement, it has adverse implications for the current system of transportation finance. Reductions in gasoline consumption relative to the amount of driving that takes place result in reductions in fuel tax revenues that fund transportation projects. The authors estimate the magnitude of the forgone tax revenue when a hybrid electric vehicle displaces a similar-sized conventional gasoline-powered vehicle. The authors find that under several vehicle electrification scenarios, the combined federal and state trust fund contributions could decline by as much as 5% because of new hybrid electric cars to be sold in 2020 and as much as 12.5% because of those to be sold in 2030. Alternative fee systems more directly tied to the use of the transportation system rather than to fuel consumption should be considered, which could reconcile energy security, environmental, and transportation finance goals. © The Author(s) 2010.","electric vehicles; environment; fuel tax; transportation finance","","","","S.

These alternative vehicles include different fuels and electrification. The ultimate for on-road CO2 reductions is a zero emission vehicle, which can be achieved by either a hydrogen fuel cell or battery electric vehicle. These vehicles would also require a renewable energy source to provide their propulsion energy in order to achieve maximum sustainability for both CO2 reduction and energy security. Renewable energy sources such as wind or solar result in heat or electricity that needs to be generated into an energy carrier such as hydrogen or stored in a battery. When examining these options based strictly on the efficiency path, previous analysis have concluded fuel cell vehicles may not be an appropriate suitability strategy in comparison to battery electric vehicles. However, the viability of an alternative vehicle requires a comprehensive assessment of the various vehicle parameters that affect the customer satisfaction. In particular, this paper examines the renewable energy consumption, range, and cost for hydrogen fuel cell and battery electric vehicles. In particular, these conflicting attributes are examined using an objective Pareto frontier analysis to evaluate the trade-offs and trends that should be considered when developing a sustainability strategy.

In the near future, the number of plug-in electric vehicles will likely grow significantly in the world. Despite the aforementioned advantages, the connection of PEV to the power grid poses a series of new challenges for electric utilities. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach for evaluating the impact of different levels of PEV penetration on distribution network investment and incremental energy losses. The proposed approach is based on the use of a large-scale distribution planning model which is used to analyze two real distribution areas. Obtained results show that depending on the charging strategies, investment costs can increase up to 15% of total actual distribution network investment costs, and energy losses can increase up to 40% in off-peak hours for a scenario with 60% of total vehicles being PEV. © 2010 IEEE.","Distribution investment; distribution network planning; electricity distribution; network energy losses; plug-in electric vehicles","Automobiles; Distributed parameter networks; Electric losses; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Power generation; Distribution investment; Distribution network planning; electricity distribution; Energy loss; Plug-ins; Investments","","","L.

The WTW analyses of BEVs, HEVs and ICEVs were conducted using the GREET (Greenhouse gases, regulated emissions, and energy use in Transportation) model developed by Argonne National Lab combined with a localized database of Chinese domestic data. A 2011 mid-size gasoline car is used as a baseline. Two types of BEV assumed in this study: Common BEVs and High-efficient BEVs. Common BEV pathways will save up to 99 % petrol consumption. However, comparing to that of HEV pathway, WTW energy consumption of all Common BEV pathways will be increased, with a maximum of 71 %. WTW energy consumption of High-efficient BEVs will be 2-29 % less than the WTW energy in the HEV pathway. GHG emissions of Common BEVs depend on differences in power generation technologies. Without CCS, the WTW GHG emissions of Common BEVs using coal-fired electricity are 11-77 % higher than the WTW GHG emissions of the baseline. When USC and IGCC generation technologies are equipped with CCS, the WTW GHG emissions of High-efficient BEVs are 79-83 % less than that of the baseline, and 69-75 % less than the hybrid pathway. This is the first time that a WTW analysis in China at this magnitude was completed with a fully localized fuel-cycle database. Outcomes of the study provide more relevance and accuracy for both the government and industry to develop strategies and policies in China. The model and database developed in this study can be used for analysis both at national and regional levels. This study did not include the energy use and GHG emissions in vehicle manufacturing stage. Although it is a small portion in the analysis, it could provide understanding of the difference in vehicle manufacturing process between EVs and traditional gasoline vehicles. This paper shows that the Common BEVs currently demonstrated are not a silver bullet for attacking energy consumption challenges and GHG emissions. In China context, full HEVs seem more attractive than Common BEVs to deal with energy security and GHG reduction challenge today. In order to achieve GHG reduction targets through vehicle electrification, China must promote CCS technology to help USC and IGCC power plants deliver low-carbon transportation energy on supply side. At the same time, High-efficient BEVs have to be set as the highest priority of automotive technology development. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","China; Electric vehicle; GHG emissions; Thermal power generation; Well-to-Wheel Analysis","Combined cycle power plants; Database systems; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Technology; Wheels; Automotive technology; Battery electric vehicles; China; Coal-fired electricity; Energy security; Energy use; Gasoline vehicle; Generation technologies; GHG emission; In-vehicle; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Low-carbon; Petrol consumption; Power generation technology; Reduction targets; Regional levels; Regulated emissions; Thermal power generation; Total energy; Well-to-wheel analysis; Greenhouse gases","","","W.

In this study, the impacts of some crucial factors on the total charging load are investigated, such as the charging rate of the charging infrastructures, the battery capacity, the preference of the charging behavior and the penetration level of the charging infrastructures in public places. A methodology is presented to estimate the charging load which needs a sample consisting of the charging schedules of a great number of EVs. As the sample isn't available at present, a real-world travel dataset of conventional vehicles is taken advantage of to generate the sample by simulating EVs considering the factors mentioned above. Thereby, the estimations of the charging load corresponding to the different values of the factors are attained, which is used for investigating the impacts of these factors in turn. Some conclusions are: 1) the charging rate of the charging infrastructures in public places has a small impact on the charging load; 2) although the larger battery capacity leads to the larger power demand, the increment is minor; 3) the preference of the charging behavior of the owners influences the charging load significantly. © 2012 IEEE.","Charging Load; Electric Vehicle; Travel Dataset","Electric vehicles; Smart power grids; Battery capacity; Charging loads; Charging rate; Data sets; Energy security; Penetration level; Power demands; Public places; Charging (batteries)","","","H.

There are two major options of energy storage systems in electric vehicles (EVs), which include one where the storage of electrical energy is done by using batteries and the other where the storage of energy is in the form of hydrogen. The Volt is an EV equipped with an additional gasoline engine that is used to extend the vehicle range beyond the electric range when required (E-REV). The main energy storage in the Volt is a Li-ion battery with a nominal energy content of 16 kWh and a pure battery-electric range of 60 km. This leads to reduced fuel consumption, reduced emissions, and also to increased energy security via geographic diversification of the available energy sources. The ultimate objective of the GM strategy is to produce zero-emission vehicles that use an electric powertrain system based on hydrogen fuel cells or purely battery-electric systems and that are also fully competitive to conventional vehicles with regards to performance and ease-of-use. E-REVs such as the Chevrolet Volt or the Opel Ampera are perfectly suited for people who may have to cover longer ranges of up to 500 km and for those who are willing to accept a small ICE in order to ensure the range beyond the initial 60 km of pure EV operation. On the other hand, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are always operated as zero-emission vehicles that can be refueled within 3-5 min, and offer a long range of about 500 km at full performance, even for family-sized cars. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We re-envision the role of hydrogen at national and international strategic levels, relying entirely on renewable energy and energy efficiency. It is suggested the time for an exclusive 'hydrogen economy' has passed, since electricity and batteries would be used extensively as well. Yet hydrogen would still play a crucial role: in road and rail vehicles requiring a range comparable to today's petrol and diesel vehicles; in coastal and international shipping; in air transport; and for longer-term seasonal storage on electricity grids relying mainly on renewables. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are proposed where medium and long distance trips are required, with plug-in battery electric vehicles reserved for just short trips. A hierarchy of spatially-distributed hydrogen production, storage and distribution centers relying on local renewable energy sources and feedstocks would be created to limit the required hydrogen pipeline network to the main metropolitan areas and regions by complementary use of electricity as a major energy vector. Bulk hydrogen storage would provide the strategic energy reserve to guarantee national and global energy security in a world relying increasingly on renewable energy. It is recommended that this vision next be applied to specific countries by conducting detailed energy-economic-environmental modeling to quantify its net benefits. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

EVs link two major infrastructures, the transportation and the electric power grid. This provides a chance to bring other sources of energy into transportation, displace petroleum and, with the right mix of power generation sources, reduce CO2 emissions. The main obstacles for introducing a large numbers of EVs are cost, battery weight, and vehicle range. Battery health is also a factor, both directly and indirectly, by introducing limits on depth of discharge. This paper considers a low-cost path for extending the range of a small urban EV by integrating a parallel hydraulic system for harvesting and reusing braking energy. The idea behind the concept is to avoid replacement of lead-acid or small Li-Ion batteries with a very expensive Li-Ion pack, and instead use a low-cost hydraulic system to achieve comparable range improvements. A Matlab/SIMULINK model was developed to simulate a baseline EV truck with a series wound DC motor and lead-acid batteries. The simulation was validated with tests at the US EPA National Vehicle and Fuel Efficiency Lab. Subsequently, the hydraulic pump/motor and accumulator models were integrated to create an EV-Hydraulic Hybrid and the simulation was used to explore tradeoffs related to improving battery health, reducing the overall energy demand, and increasing the range. Preliminary strategy was focused on maximizing the driving range, but insight obtained through the analysis of interactions in the system enabled refinements that significantly benefit battery health without compromising electric range.

This paper focuses on the life-cycle analysis (LCA) for transportation fuels from unconventional hydrocarbon sources and associated regulatory issues and implications, and examines these in the context of experience gained in the study of conventional hydrocarbon sources, biofuels, electric vehicles, and other alternatives. Critical issues arise in the regulatory use of life-cycle emissions analysis when comparing different types of fuels, for different types of vehicles, including the following. (1) Uncertainty in life-cycle emission - differences in estimates of the life-cycle emissions for one fuel can exceed the differences in estimates for different fuels. Boundaries, accounting, aggregation and accuracy of LCA are each critical and determining issues in its application in regulations. (2) Flexible pathways are needed to map production from each individual agent, who will have their own process. (3) Energy security - regulation to lower the life-cycle emissions is often also intended to improve energy security. However, in the case of unconventional sources of oil such regulations may aggravate energy security. For complex policies, such as those involving LCA - especially where there are international ramifications - much broader dialogue is needed to improve the policy's effectiveness, efficiency and ultimately credibility.","","","","","","","","","978-161399179-4","","","English","Carbon Management Technology Conference [CMTC] (Orlando, FL, 2/7-9/2012) Proceedings","Abstract report","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84889909341"

Advanced infrastructure planning can minimize the cost of hydrogen infrastructure while assuring that energy and environment benefits are achieved. This study presents a comprehensive advanced planning methodology for the deployment of hydrogen infrastructure, and applies the methodology to delineate fully built-out infrastructure strategies, assess the associated energy and environment impacts, facilitate the identification of an optimal infrastructure roll-out strategy, and identify the potential for renewable hydrogen feedstocks. The South Coast Air Basin of California, targeted by automobile manufacturers for the first regional commercial deployment of FCEVs, is the focus for the study. The following insights result from the application of the methodology:Compared to current gasoline stations, only 11%-14% of the number of hydrogen fueling stations can provide comparable accessibility to drivers in a targeted region.To meet reasonable capacity demand for hydrogen fueling, approximately 30% the number of hydrogen stations are required compared to current gasoline stations.Replacing gasoline vehicles with hydrogen FCEVs has the potential to (1) reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by more than 80%, reduce energy requirements by 42%, and virtually eliminate petroleum consumption from the passenger vehicle sector, and (2) significantly reduce urban concentrations of ozone and PM2.5.Existing sources of biomethane in the California South Coast Air Basin can provide up to 30% of the hydrogen fueling demand for a fully built-out hydrogen FCEV scenario.A step-wise transition of judiciously located existing gasoline stations to dispense and accommodate the increasing demand for hydrogen addresses proactively key infrastructure deployment challenges including a viable business model, zoning, permitting, and public acceptance. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

However, there is much uncertainty in the impact that PHEVs can have on energy consumption and related emissions, as they are dependent on vehicle technology, driving patterns, and charging behavior. A methodology is used to simulate PHEV charging and gasoline consumption based on driving pattern data in USDOT's National Household Travel Survey. The method uses information from each trip taken by approximately 170,000 vehicles to track their battery state of charge throughout the day, and to determine the timing and quantity of electricity and gasoline consumption for a fleet of PHEVs. Scenarios were developed to examine the effects of charging location, charging rate, time of charging and battery size. Additionally, demographic information was examined to see how driver and household characteristics influence consumption patterns. Results showed that a compact vehicle with a 10.4. kW. h useable battery (approximately a 42. mile [68. km] all electric range) travels between 62.5% and 75.7% on battery electricity, depending on charging scenario. The percent of travel driven electrically (Utility Factor, UF) in a baseline charging scenario increased from 64.3% using 2001 NHTS data to 66.7% using 2009 data. The average UF was 63.5% for males and 72.9% for females and in both cases they are highly sensitive to age. Vehicle charging load profiles across charging scenarios and demographics show a varying effect on summertime peak load, which can be useful for PHEV market segmentation and electric utility planning. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Charging; Demographics; Electric range; PHEV; Travel patterns; Utility factor","United States; Charging (furnace); Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Population statistics; Vehicles; Demographics; Electric range; PHEV; Travel patterns; Utility factor; automobile industry; consumption behavior; demography; electric vehicle; emission control; energy planning; energy use; fuel consumption; household survey; petroleum; travel behavior; uncertainty analysis; Charging (batteries)","DTE Energy; National Science Foundation, NSF, (0835995); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-PI0000012); Michigan Public Service Commission, MPSC","This research was funded through the DTE Energy – Michigan Public Service Commission PHEV Pilot Project and the NSF EFRI RESIN grant [Award No. 0835995].

Measures for the power system stability and reliability are necessary because a large integration of these renewable energy sources causes some problems in power systems, e.g. frequency fluctuation and distribution voltage rise, and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is one of effective solutions to these problems. Due to a high cost of the BESS, our research group has studied an application of controllable loads such as Heat Pump Water Heater (HPWH) and Electric Vehicle (EV) to the power system control for reduction of the required capacity of BESS. This paper proposes a new coordinated Load Frequency Control (LFC) method for the conventional power plants, the BESS, the HPWHs, and the EVs.

Energy consumption in Japan's transport sector has been dominated by petroleum, and CO2 emissions in this sector accounts for twenty percent of Japan's CO2 emissions. Therefore, the deployment of clean energy vehicles, such as EV and PHEV, are expected to play a significant role in tackling with energy security and environmental concerns. For assessing energy and environmental benefits of EV and PHEV, we develop energy system model integrating optimal power generation mix model and vehicle penetration model, considering optimal electricity charging profile of those advanced vehicles. Calculated results suggest that massive EV penetration serves as energy saving measure in Japan's whole energy system, due to significant petroleum reduction exceeding the growth of fuel input into power generation sector derived from significant EV and PHEV penetration. Massive EV deployment is estimated to contribute to CO2 mitigation of the energy system as well. Evaluating CO2 emissions per mileage by automobile, however, carbon emissions per mileage of EV is almost equivalent to that of gasoline hybrid vehicle (HEV) in the case of decommissioning nuclear power plant which eventually causes higher carbon intensity of electricity supply. © 2013 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.","Electric vehicle; Optimal power generation mix model; Plug-in hybrid vehicle; Vehicle penetration model","Electric power generation; Electric vehicles; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Nuclear power plants; Optimization; Petroleum transportation; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Advanced vehicle; Carbon emissions; Carbon intensity; Clean energy vehicles; Electricity supply; Energy security; Energy supply mix; Energy system model; Energy systems; Energy-saving measures; Environmental benefits; Environmental concerns; Optimal power; Power generation mix; Transport sectors; Vehicle penetration; Carbon dioxide","","","","","","13488147","","","","Japanese","IEEJ Trans.

Nissan has been developing both electric vehicles (EVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) as zero emission vehicles for CO2 emissions reduction. Research and development work on Nissan FCVs has been under way since 1996. The main issues that must be addressed to commercialize FCVs include: (1) preventing performance decay, (2) developing technologies for reducing costs, (3) increasing power density and (4) improving subzero start-up capability. Fundamental research activities undertaken to resolve these issues have elucidated various phenomena such as the mass transportation and degradation mechanisms in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and corrosion on metal bipolar plates. These activities have accumulated the following technologies and results: (1) method of estimating performance decay, (2) surface treatment technology for corrosion-proofing metal bipolar plates, (3) verification of improved subzero start-up capability and (4) MEA specifications for high current density operation with low cathode humidity and reduced cost. These technologies have been incorporated in a Nissan fuel cell stack 2008 model that achieves a power density of 1.9 kW/L (130 kW/68 L) and a lower cost by halving the amount of Pt catalyst compared with the previous stack model. The performance and durability of the new stack are close to satisfying the requirements for real-world use. However, new stack cost needs additional reduction. One effective approach to reducing the cost is to lower the amount of Pt catalysts used by utilizing Pt more effectively. Toward that end, it is important to further analyze the reaction and physical transport mechanisms taking place at the electrode catalyst layer. This paper presents the results achieved to date and describes various activities under way to address the two major issues, namely performance decay and cost reduction, among the four main issues mentioned above.","Cost; Durability; FCV","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst supports; Corrosion; Costs; Degradation; Durability; Electric vehicles; Electrodes; Emission control; Fuel cells; Global warming; Platinum; Degradation mechanism; Electric Vehicles (EVs); FCV; High current densities; Membrane electrode assemblies; Research and development; Surface treatment technology; Zero emission vehicles; Cost reduction","","","","","Electric Drive Transportation Association","","","","","English","EVS - Sustainable Mobil.

Hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles are a few such examples. Such diversification requires the use of power control units essentially for power control, power conversion and power conditioning applications such as variable speed motor drives (dc-ac conversion), dc-dc converters and other similar devices. Power control unit of a hybrid electric vehicle or electric vehicle is essentially the brain of the hybrid system as it manages the power flow between the electric motor generator, battery and gas engine. Over the last few years, the performance of this power control unit has been improved and size has been reduced to attain higher efficiency and performance causing the heat dissipation as well as heat density to increase significantly. Efforts are constantly being made to reduce this size even further. As a consequence, a better high performance cooler/heat exchanger is required to maintain the active devices temperature within optimum range. Jet impingement is one such cooling scheme which has been widely used to dissipate transient and steady concentrated heat loads and can be applied to existing cooling system with minor modifications. The aim of the present study has therefore been to study the various cooling options based on impingement for application in hybrid electric vehicle and other similar consumer products and perform parametric and optimization study on the selected designs.

China's transportation fleet is projected to expand from 16 to 94 million vehicles between 2000 and 2020, with liquid and electricity transport fuel demand growing from about 5 Quadrillion British Thermal Units (Quads) to over 20 Quads in 2035. In response to energy security, economic growth and environmental protection needs, Chinese government agencies, academia and the private sector have organized their programs and investments to advance development and demonstration of sustainable alternative transportation systems. This analysis surveys historic development of fuel cell vehicle (FCV) including fuel cell buses (FCB) technology in China, summarizes recent efforts to scale-up FCV development and associated infrastructure in major Chinese cities, and briefly addresses future directions in Chinese fuel cell and hydrogen energy technology development. Since the late 1990's, Chinese universities, government institutions and the private sector have implemented research, development, demonstration and deployment programs for electric (EV), fuel cell (FCV), and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). These efforts have advanced the feasibility of FCVs to be a part of sustainable urban transportation system, including technical performance, infrastructure, and customer acceptance. Three generations of FCVs, START I, START II and START III have been developed, demonstrated and deployed. Similarly, several generations of FCBs have been developed and demonstrated. Collectively, these efforts have demonstrated and deployed over 1,000 FCBs and FCVs in several Chinese cities. Large-scale, intensive-use FCV and FCB demonstration trials, including those during the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai World Exposition (EXPO), have been successfully built and operated. Infrastructure, such as hydrogen production facilities, fuelling stations, and maintenance stations have been constructed and operated to support the fleets of FCBs and FCVs. Experiences learned from these FCV research, development, and demonstration activities are the foundation for scaling up infrastructure and fleet trials in a growing number of cities in eastern and western China. An aggressive research and development vision and 2020 technology performance targets provide a foundation for the next generation of EVs, FCVs and HEVs, and, options for China's efforts to develop a portfolio of sustainable transportation systems. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Almost US$110 million has been directed to research and development efforts to develop advanced hybrid-electric drives and FCVs as part of its 10th 5 Year Economic Development Plan for high-tech industries in China (Ministry of Finance 2010). Subsequently, another US$93 million has been committed to advanced energy technology, with approximately US$27 million for hydrogen and fuel cell technology. Basic scientific research has also been supported by MOST, with millions of dollars invested in advanced hydrogen production, storage materials, fuel cell membranes, and catalysts. Chinese provincial, municipal, academic and private sector organizations have leveraged MOST funds and enabled China to develop components and supplier bases for fuel cell stacks, membrane electrode assemblies and bipolar plates, and fuel cell vehicle power train platforms (Chen et al. 2008). Several FCV manufacturing and commercial demonstrations have been established in different cities, incorporating both Chinese-and foreign-made technologies (Sullivan 2010). Partnerships and alliances have been formed to stimulate cooperative learning and support demonstration and commercialization. Investments by MOST have also been complemented by the GEF and other international sources (Dixon et al. 2011; Ministry of Finance 2010; GEF 2009).","M. Q.

As battery capacity and all-electric range of PHEV's are improved, and potentially some PHEV's or EV's need fast charging, there is increased demand to build high power off-board charging infrastructures. A charge station architecture for municipal parking decks has been proposed, which has a DC microgrid to interface with multiple DC-DC chargers, distributed renewable power generations and energy storage, and provides functionalities of normal and rapid charging, grid support such as reactive and real power injection (including V2G), current harmonic filtering and load balance. Several non-isolated bidirectional DC-DC converters suited for charge station applications have been reviewed and compared, as the major focus of this paper. Half bridge converter is a good candidate but it is difficult to maintain high efficiency in wide battery pack voltage range. A variable frequency pulse width modulation (VFPWM) scheme is proposed to mitigate this issue. Finally three-level bi-directional DC-DC converter is suggested to be employed in this application. A 10kW prototype verifies that 95.1-97.9% full load efficiency can be achieved in charging mode with 180-360V battery pack voltage. In addition, the inductor size is only one third of the half bridge counterpart, which is a great advantage for high power converters. ©2010 IEEE.","","Automobile electronic equipment; Automobile parts and equipment; DC-DC converters; Electric converters; Electric vehicles; Fuzzy control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Mesh generation; Power electronics; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Battery capacity; Battery pack; Bidirectional DC-DC converters; Current harmonics; Dc micro-grid; Electric range; Energy security; Fast charging; Fuel cost; Full-load efficiency; Half bridge; Half-bridge converters; High efficiency; High power converters; High-power; Load balance; Parking deck; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Real power; Renewable power generation; Station architecture; Three-level; Variable frequencies; Voltage ranges; Charging (batteries)","","","Y.

A bottom up energy system model of Nepal based on the MARKAL framework was developed to assess the effects of meeting a part of the land transport service demand through electrified mass transport system and electric vehicles. The present study shows that if the share of electricity based transport services is to grow from 10% in 2015 to 35% by 2050, the hydropower generation capacity would have to increase by 495MW by 2050 as compared to the base case, while the annual electricity generation in 2050 would have to increase by 7.86TWh. As a result, the cumulative total imported energy would decrease by 14.6% in the 35% transport electrification scenario as compared to the base case during 2015-2050. In addition, the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by 12.9% (74.7milliontonsCO2e) in the same scenario during 2015-2050. © 2011 International Energy Initiative.","Co-benefits; Energy security; Greenhouse gas; Hydropower development; MARKAL; Transport sector electrification","Nepal; Climate change; Developing countries; Electric utilities; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Transportation; Co benefits; Electricity generation; Environmental emissions; Hydro-power development; Hydro-power generation; Hydro-power resources; MARKAL; Transport sector electrifications; alternative energy; climate change; electricity generation; electricity supply; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric power; renewable resource; sustainable development; Energy security","Norwegian Ministry of Finance; Asian Institute of Technology, AIT","We would like to thank the editor and anonymous reviewers of the journal for their valuable comments on an earlier version of the paper.

The Quest continues and expands the story commencing with the First Gulf War, the fall of the Berlin Wall and Soviet Union up to the present. It encompasses every conceivable effort to develop conventional and unconventional fossil fuel sources as well as renewables, nuclear power, hybrid and electric vehicles, and energy efficiency in the context of the world's growing population, global trade and commerce, and technological innovation. 'The Quest' is a liberal education in and of itself, providing the persevering reader with ample dollops of science, engineering, policy, economics, finance, and biography. Yergin calmly, patiently explains the error in the concept of 'peak oil,' which assumes that the world is near or at the point of maximum output, and that an inexorable decline has already begun, or is soon to set in.","","electric vehicle; energy efficiency; fossil fuel; innovation; nuclear power; renewable resource","","","G.T.

Electrified vehicles contain substantial amounts of lithium and rare earth elements. There has been concern that the supplies of lithium may not be sufficient to support the development of a large scale global fleet of electric vehicles. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the global lithium resources and compared it to an assessment of global lithium demand from 2010 to 2100 that assumes rapid and widespread adoption of electrified vehicles. We show that that even with rapid and widespread adoption of electric vehicles powered by lithium-ion batteries lithium resources are sufficient to support demand until at least 2100. The future availability of rare earth elements (REEs) is of concern due to monopolistic supply conditions, environmentally unsustainable mining practices, and rapid demand growth. We evaluated potential future demand scenarios for REEs with a focus on the issue of co-mining. In the absence of efficient reuse and recycling or the development of technologies which use lower amounts of Dy and Nd, following a path consistent with stabilization of atmospheric CO2 at 450 ppm may lead to an increase in demand of more than 700 and 2,600 % for Nd and Dy, respectively, over the next 25 years. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Lithium; Rare earth elements; Sustainability","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Electric vehicles; Neodymium; Rare earth elements; Sustainable development; Atmospheric CO; Comprehensive analysis; Demand growth; Energy security; Lithium-ion battery; Reuse and recycling; Sustainable mobility; Lithium","","","T.J.
