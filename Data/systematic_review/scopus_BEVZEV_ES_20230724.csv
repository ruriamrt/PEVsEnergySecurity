There are three major types of electric vehicles: battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). BEVs and FCEVs produce no tailpipe emissions while PHEVs do when they operate on the internal combustion engine. In addition to direct emissions such as those from tailpipe, life-cycle emissions of EVs also include all emissions related to fuel and vehicle production, processing, distribution, use, and recycling or disposal. The life-cycle emissions depend largely on the mix of electricity generation sources. EVs can significantly reduce emissions where they are used, but may increase emissions from the power plants that generate electrificity for them. The net impact on public health will depend on the changes in air quality and the population at those localities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to relieve those problems, new energy vehicles are introduced into the bus and car market. We adopt life cycle analysis to evaluate the well-to-wheels (WTW) energy consumption, CO2 emissions and pollutant emissions from the traditional diesel bus and new energy buses, including diesel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), compressed natural gas vehicles (CNGVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). This study reports the current situation and projects future scenarios for the BEV bus for several regions in China due to significant regional differences in the power generation mix. Compared to the diesel bus, the HEV bus can reduce petroleum, fossil fuel use and CO2 emissions by about 20%, and, at the same time, produce stable reduction benefits for all air pollutants. The CNG bus achieves reductions of WTW primary PM2.5 emissions by 70% over its diesel counterpart and, of course, uses little petroleum; but increases fossil fuel consumption moderately and has no benefit in GHG emissions. The BEV bus can deliver a substantial petroleum consumption advantage and greatly reduce the WTW NOX, VOC and CO emissions; but, if the electricity is generated from burning coal, the BEV bus has no PM2.5 emission benefit compared to the conventional diesel bus. Currently, the BEV bus increases fossil energy use and CO2 emissions in the coal-dominated regions; but, in the future, it can achieve substantially lower fossil energy use and CO2 emissions with more penetration of clean electric energy. To reach the win-win strategy, a city's initial reliance on diesel buses for the public fleet has to give way to a mixture of these new energy buses; and the fleet mix should be diversified over the region and modified over time to accommodate changes in these energy and environmental parameters. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Air pollution; CNG bus; CO<sub>2</sub>; Electric bus; Energy security; Life cycle analysis,China; Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Compressed natural gas; Energy security; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Life cycle; Natural gas; Natural gas vehicles; Pollution; Vehicles; Battery electric vehicles; Electric bus; Energy conservation and environmental protections; Environmental parameter; Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); Life cycle analysis; Petroleum consumption; Regional differences; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; diesel; energy conservation; energy use; environmental protection; fossil fuel; fuel; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; particulate matter; petroleum; pollution control; power generation; traffic emission; Fleet operations,"National High Technology Research and Development Program (863) of China, (2013AA065303); National Science & Technology Pillar Program of China, (2013BAC13B03); Energy Foundation, EF, (G-1104-14046); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51322804, 51378285); Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality, CICREQ; Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GIZ","This study was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51322804 and 51378285 ), the National High Technology Research and Development Program (863) of China (No. 2013AA065303 ), the National Science & Technology Pillar Program of China (No. 2013BAC13B03 ), the Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality, the Energy Foundation (G-1104-14046), and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).

Electric vehicles, powered by lithium-ion batteries, have started to attain a noticeable market share recently due to their stable performance and maturity as a technology. However, electric vehicles continue to suffer from two disadvantages that have limited widespread adoption: charging time and energy density. To mitigate these challenges, vehicle Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) have developed different vehicle architectures to extend the vehicle range. This work seeks to compare various powertrains, including: combined power battery electric vehicles (BEV) (zinc-air and lithium-ion battery), zero emission fuel cell vehicles (FCV)), conventional gasoline powered vehicles (baseline internal combustion vehicle), and ICE engine extended range hybrid electric vehicle. The parameters of comparison are: energy consumption, range, life cycle and tailpipe emissions, cost, and customer acceptance. A unique zinc-air battery model was developed using the vehicle modelling software to perform the analysis, with consideration of research data, current market status, and controls logic of the dual energy systems powertrain. Modelling of the five powertrains was performed using the vehicle modelling software Autonomie. In correspondence with the EcoCar 3 competition [1], the 2015 Chevrolet Camaro was used as the vehicle architecture platform. A powertrain decision matrix was developed to compare these powertrains from the metrics of energy consumption, emissions, customer acceptance, and life cycle cost. Emissions analysis is completed as a Well-to-Wheel' analysis in order to take into account all sources of emissions production. As expected, all powertrains devoid of a gasoline internal combustion engine had lower tailpipe and greenhouse gas emissions. Powertrains powered by battery power alone, however, were not able to achieve the total range target, but it will be shown that developments in the metal-air battery will aid in addressing this limitation. © 2017 SAE International.",,Automobile manufacture; Automotive industry; Battery electric vehicles; Battery management systems; Combustion; Commerce; Competition; Energy security; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Exhaust systems (engine); Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Ion engines; Life cycle; Lithium-ion batteries; Metal analysis; Zinc; Conventional gasoline; Customer acceptance; Environmental policy; Extended-range electric vehicles; Internal combustion; Original equipment manufacturers; Security considerations; Vehicle architecture; Powertrains,,,"J.

This study presents a well-to-wheel (WTW) analysis to estimate the WTW fossil fuel consumption, GHG emission and air pollutants emissions of VOCs, CO, NOx, SOx, PM2.5 and PM10 for HFCV under 12 hydrogen pathways in China for the current (2017) and near future (2030). The results were compared with the gasoline-fueled internal combustion engine vehicle (gasoline-ICEV) and battery electric vehicle (BEV) counterparts. The results show that HFCV can reduce 11–92% fossil fuel consumption compared with gasoline-ICEV in 2017, with one exception that HFCV based on on-site water electrolysis by grid electricity in which fossil fuel consumption increased by 10% instead. Compared with BEV, HFCV based on by-product hydrogen from chlor-alkali process and renewable water electrolysis have the fossil fuel consumption reduction benefits. Regarding GHG emissions, HFCV based on water electrolysis using the renewable electricity performs the best with a value of 31 g CO2-eq/km while that based on on-site water electrolysis using grid electricity performs the worst with a value of 431 g CO2-eq/km in 2017. For air pollutants, HFCV based on all hydrogen pathways can achieve a significant reduction of VOCs and CO emissions on a WTW basis, in comparison with gasoline-ICEV in 2017. In terms of NOx, SOx, PM2.5 and PM10, HFCV based on on-site water electrolysis by grid electricity electrolysis has the highest emissions due to high emission factors of the electricity generation process. Moreover, due to increased share of renewable electricity and improvement in the fuel economy, reductions in WTW fossil fuel consumption and pollutants emissions are excepted by 2030. This study indicates the importance of hydrogen production when considering the energy and environment performance of HFCV to ensure a life cycle low carbon and air pollutants emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Air pollutants; Energy consumption; Greenhouse gas emission; Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle; Well-to-wheel analysis,Air pollution; Artificial life; Battery electric vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Electric power transmission networks; Electrolysis; Energy security; Energy utilization; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Gas fuel analysis; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Life cycle; Nitrogen oxides; Vehicle-to-grid; Wheels; Electricity generation; Energy and environment; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Renewable electricity; Transportation sector; Well-to-wheel analysis; Fossil fuels,"China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201707040082)",The first author acknowledges the support of China Scholarship council (no. 201707040082).

However a major barrier to the introduction of BEVs is their limited battery capacity and long charging durations. To address these issues of BEVs several solutions are proposed such as battery swapping and fast charging stations. However apart from these stationary modes of charging, recently a new mode of charging has been introduced which is called inductive charging. This allows charging of BEVs as they drive along roads without the need of plugs, using induction. But it is unclear, if and how such technology could be utilized best. In order to investigate the possible impact of the introduction of such inductive charging infrastructure, its potential and its optimal placement, a framework for simulating BEVs using a multi-agent transport simulation was used. This framework was extended by an inductive charging module and initial test runs were performed. In this paper we present the simulation results of these preliminary tests together with analysis which suggests that battery sizes of BEVs could be reduced even if inductive charging technology is implemented only at a small number of high traffic volume links. The paper also demonstrates that our model can effectively support policy and decision making for deploying inductive charging infrastructure. © 2014, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

There are, however, substantial technical, social, and economic barriers to widespread adoption of electric vehicles, including vehicle cost, small driving range, long charging times, and the need for a charging infrastructure. In addition, people are unfamiliar with electric vehicles, are uncertain about their costs and benefits, and have diverse needs that current electric vehicles might not meet. Although a person might derive some personal benefits from ownership, the costs of achieving the social benefits, such as reduced GHG emissions, are borne largely by the people who purchase the vehicles. Given the recognized barriers to electric-vehicle adoption, Congress asked the Department of Energy (DOE) to commission a study by the National Academies to address market barriers that are slowing the purchase of electric vehicles and hindering the deployment of supporting infrastructure. As a result of the request, the National Research Council (NRC)-a part of the National Academies-appointed the Committee on Overcoming Barriers to Electric-Vehicle Deployment. This committee documented their findings in two reports-a short interim report focused on near-term options, and a final comprehensive report. Overcoming Barriers to Electric-Vehicle Deployment fulfills the request for the short interim report that addresses specifically the following issues: infrastructure needs for electric vehicles, barriers to deploying the infrastructure, and possible roles of the federal government in overcoming the barriers. This report also includes an initial discussion of the pros and cons of the possible roles. This interim report does not address the committee's full statement of task and does not offer any recommendations because the committee is still in its early stages of data-gathering. The committee will continue to gather and review information and conduct analyses through late spring 2014 and will issue its final report in late summer 2014. Overcoming Barriers to Electric-Vehicle Deployment focuses on the light-duty vehicle sector in the United States and restricts its discussion of electric vehicles to plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), which include battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The common feature of these vehicles is that their batteries are charged by being plugged into the electric grid. BEVs differ from PHEVs because they operate solely on electricity stored in a battery (that is, there is no other power source); PHEVs have internal combustion engines that can supplement the electric power train. Although this report considers PEVs generally, the committee recognizes that there are fundamental differences between PHEVs and BEVs. © 2013 by the National Academy of Sciences.

Thus, governments have implemented incentive policies to stimulate the adoption of EVs. In this study, by linking Multi-criteria decision analysis and an energy system model, an evaluation framework of fiscal policies for the adoption of electric vehicles is developed. Primarily, the energy system model for Iceland is applied to compare the impacts of five fiscal policy incentives with BAU until 2050, in terms of government revenue, consumer's vehicle ownership cost, the GHG mitigation potential and energy security. Then, the policy scenarios are compared using the TOPSIS method. According to the estimated performance indexes for policy scenarios, Feebate+Tax scenario receives the highest rank. This ranking is consistent across different normalization norms and objective weights. In the Feebate+Tax scenario, a fee equivalent to 20% of conventional ICEV price is imposed on both petroleum ICEVs and HEVs, while an equivalent rebate value is provided to the purchase price of light-duty BEV and heavy-duty PHEV. In addition, an extra excise duty and a carbon tax are levied on petroleum fuels. The sensitivity of rankings with respect to the effects of different battery characteristics for EVs, is explored. Based on Pareto efficiency, the Feebate+Tax scenario was found to be the only non-dominated option across three objective weights. Thus, the recommendation of Feebate+Tax as the promising policy is unaffected by the variation in the range and cost of batteries. © 2017 The Authors.

Moreover, the demand for jet fuel and diesel is projected to grow faster than the demand for gasoline in the future, and is likely to result in low-octane gasoline components becoming more readily available. Significant initiatives with varying motivations are taking place to develop the battery electric vehicle (BEV) and the fuel cell as alternatives to ICE vehicles, and to establish fuels such as biofuels and natural gas as alternatives to conventional liquid fuels. However, each of these alternatives starts from a very low base and faces significant barriers to fast and unrestrained growth; thus, transport—and particularly commercial transport—will continue to be largely powered by ICEs running on petroleum-based liquid fuels for decades to come. Hence, the sustainability of transport in terms of affordability, energy security, and impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air quality can only be ensured by improving ICEs. Indeed, ICEs will continue to improve while using current market fuels, through improvements in combustion, control, and after-treatment systems, assisted by partial electrification in the form of hybridization. However, there is even more scope for improvement through the development of fuel/engine systems that can additionally leverage benefits in fuels manufacture and use components that may be readily available. Gasoline compression ignition (GCI), which uses low-octane gasoline in a compression ignition engine, is one such example. GCI would enable diesel-like efficiencies while making it easier to control nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates at a lower cost compared with modern diesel engines. Octane on demand (OOD) also helps to ensure optimum use of available fuel anti-knock quality, and thus improves the overall efficiency of the system. © 2019 THE AUTHOR",Diesel; Gasoline; Internal combustion engines; Transport energy,Air quality; Automobile manufacture; Battery electric vehicles; Combustion; Diesel engines; Energy security; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; Liquids; Natural gas vehicles; Nitrogen oxides; Petroleum transportation; Compression ignition; Compression ignition engine; Demand for gasolines; Diesel; Internal combustion engines (ICEs); Petroleum-based liquids; Sustainable transport; Transport energy; Biofuels,,,,,Elsevier Ltd,20958099,,,,English,Engineering,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064484034

Among the renewable power technologies, the wind power takes a considerable share to supply the electricity demand in many networks. The wind is intermittent and its power output needs an auxiliary support to serve the energy customers and to limit impacts. The emerging battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are a potential source that can be used to mitigate intermittent effects of wind power outputs in modern distribution networks. BEVs are inherited with the mobility advantage and they can be used as a battery-based energy storage solution to smooth intermittent power outputs. Taking into account the mobility advantage of BEVs, the paper investigates the strategic ability of them to enhance the reliability performance of an unbalanced power distribution network by incorporating the provision of smart coordination of vehicles. Operation of BEVs is characterized by using charging and discharging rates, depth of discharge, and their states of charge at times of operation. A set of case studies were performed by integrating generic distribution network models to a power transmission network model. The results suggest that strategic operation of BEVs can potentially provide a considerable opportunity to build capacity required for wind power in smart power distribution systems. Results also depict that the necessary BEV capacity to mitigate wind impacts on reliability does not necessarily correlate with installed capacities of wind plants. A quantitative assessment provides detailed information of impact thresholds. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",,Climate change; Crashworthiness; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Greenhouse gases; Vehicle performance; Vehicles; Wind power; Battery electric vehicles; Performance assessment; Power distribution network; Quantitative assessments; Reliability performance; Renewable power generation; Smart distribution networks; Smart power distribution systems; Secondary batteries,,,,,American Institute of Physics Inc.,19417012,,,,English,J.

In addition, energy efficiency measures can reduce consumption, making it easier to shift to a zero-carbon society. In Québec, upgrades to aging buildings that employ electric resistance heating offer a unique opportunity to free up large amounts of hydroelectricity that can serve to decarbonize heating in other buildings. However, another source of energy would be needed to electrify mobility because efficiency measures free up small amounts of electricity in summer compared to winter. This study reveals how building efficiency measures combined with solar electricity generation provide an energy profile that matches the requirements for decarbonizing both mobility and heating. The TRNSYS software was used to simulate the annual energy performance of an existing house and retrofitted/rebuilt low-energy houses equipped with a photovoltaic (PV) roof in Montreal, Québec, Canada (45.5◦ N). The electricity that is made available by upgrading the houses is mainly considered for powering battery and fuel cell electric vehicles (BEVs and FCEVs) and electrifying heating in greenhouses. The results indicate that retrofitting 16% or rebuilding 12% of single-detached homes in Québec can provide enough electricity to decarbonize heating energy use in existing greenhouses and to operate the new greenhouses required for growing all fresh vegetables locally. If all the single-detached houses that employ electric resistance heating are upgraded, 33.4 and 21.8 TWh year−1 of electricity would be available for decarbonization, equivalent to a 19% and 12% increase of the province’s electricity supply for the retrofitted or rebuilt houses, respectively. This is enough energy to convert 83–100% of personal vehicles to BEVs or 35–56% to FCEVs. Decarbonization using the electricity that is made available by upgrading to low-energy solar houses could reduce the province’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by approximately 32% (26.5 MtCO2eq). The time required for the initial embodied GHG emissions to surpass the emissions avoided by electrification ranges from 3.4 to 11.2 years. Building energy efficiency retrofits/rebuilds combined with photovoltaics is a promising approach for Québec to maximize the decarbonization potential of its existing energy resources while providing local energy and food security. © 2021 by the authors.

Nowadays, compared to gasoline vehicles, whether the EVs are more competitive in terms of cost is still a question. There is no consensus achieved since the total cost depends on the development stage of the automobile industry and power generation structure as well as the cost accounting boundary. Many of existing studies did not include the costs occurred in all the stages. In response to this concern, this study estimates the lifecycle cost covering the whole process of production, use, disposal, and infrastructure construction as well as externalities for passenger battery electric vehicle (BEV), fuel cell vehicle (FCV), and gasoline vehicle (GV) by applying the comprehensive lifecycle cost model to China. The results indicate that in 2018, BEV and FCV were more expensive than GV (1.2–5.3 times), but that BEV will become cheaper after 2025, and its cost advantage will be enlarged to $419 (5%) compared to GV by 2030. The lifecycle cost of FCV will be $527 (or 5%) lower than that of GV by 2030. These results clarify that the costs of vehicle production account for the largest proportion in the total lifecycle cost. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Battery electric vehicle (BEV); China; Cost competitive; Fuel cell vehicle (FCV); Lifecycle cost model,Air Pollution; China; Electricity; Gasoline; Motor Vehicles; Vehicle Emissions; China; gasoline; atmospheric pollution; automobile industry; cost analysis; electric vehicle; fuel cell; life cycle analysis; power generation; air pollution; China; electricity; exhaust gas; motor vehicle,"China’s National Key R&D Program, (2016YFA0602603); Graduate Technological Innovation Project of Beijing Institute of Technology, (2018CX20005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (71521002, 71603020, 71642004, 71822401, 71904180); Beijing Municipal Commission of Education; Huo Yingdong Education Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (JQ19035)","This study received financial supports from the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (JQ19035), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71822401, 71603020, 71521002, 71904180, and 71642004), China’s National Key R&D Program (2016YFA0602603), Huo Yingdong Education Fund, the Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education, and the Graduate Technological Innovation Project of Beijing Institute of Technology (No. 2018CX20005).

However, the emission reduction impacts of EVs in China have been widely debated and the conclusions of existing studies are still controversial. In this study, we adopted the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to evaluate the carbon dioxide (CO2) and air pollutant emissions from the stage of vehicle production, vehicle use and vehicle end-of-life. We further compared the emissions of three types of passenger vehicles in China, including internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), and battery electric vehicle (BEV). Compared with ICEV, BEV and PHEV were found to reduce the emissions of CO2, VOCs, and NOX, but increase the emissions of PM2.5 and SO2. These differences were primarily caused by EV's high fuel efficiency and high fuel consumption of ICEV. Additional findings indicate that the emissions of PM2.5 and SO2 of BEV were 2.6 and 2.1 times that of ICEV, respectively; and the emissions of PM2.5 and SO2 of PHEV were 1.8 and 1.5 times that of ICEV, respectively. Moreover, we found the emissions of PM2.5 and SO2 of EV will be higher than that of ICEV in high renewable energy scenario with higher biomass share if keeping the emission factor of electricity constant. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Air pollutants; Carbon dioxide emissions; China; Electric vehicle; Life cycle assessment,Air quality; Battery electric vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Combustion; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy security; Internal combustion engines; Life cycle; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutant emission; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental assessment; Global climate changes; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Vehicle end-of-life; Plug-in hybrid vehicles,"China's National Key R&D Program; China’s National Key R&D Program, (2016YFA0602603); Graduate Technological Innovation Project of Beijing Institute of Technology; Huo Yingdong education fund , Training and Practice Base for Innovative Energy Talents; Huo Yingdong education fund, Training and Practice Base for Innovative Energy Talents; National Bureau of Statistics of China, NBS, (2018CX20005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71521002, 71603020, 71642004, 71822401, 71904180); Beijing Municipal Commission of Education; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (JQ19035)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge financial support received through China's National Key R&D Program (2016YFA0602603) and from Beijing Natural Science Foundation (JQ19035), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71822401, 71603020, 71521002, 71904180 and 71642004), Huo Yingdong education fund, Training and Practice Base for Innovative Energy Talents, the Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education, and the Graduate Technological Innovation Project of Beijing Institute of Technology (NBS, 2018CX20005).

The WTW analyses of BEVs, HEVs and ICEVs were conducted using the GREET (Greenhouse gases, regulated emissions, and energy use in Transportation) model developed by Argonne National Lab combined with a localized database of Chinese domestic data. A 2011 mid-size gasoline car is used as a baseline. Two types of BEV assumed in this study: Common BEVs and High-efficient BEVs. Common BEV pathways will save up to 99 % petrol consumption. However, comparing to that of HEV pathway, WTW energy consumption of all Common BEV pathways will be increased, with a maximum of 71 %. WTW energy consumption of High-efficient BEVs will be 2-29 % less than the WTW energy in the HEV pathway. GHG emissions of Common BEVs depend on differences in power generation technologies. Without CCS, the WTW GHG emissions of Common BEVs using coal-fired electricity are 11-77 % higher than the WTW GHG emissions of the baseline. When USC and IGCC generation technologies are equipped with CCS, the WTW GHG emissions of High-efficient BEVs are 79-83 % less than that of the baseline, and 69-75 % less than the hybrid pathway. This is the first time that a WTW analysis in China at this magnitude was completed with a fully localized fuel-cycle database. Outcomes of the study provide more relevance and accuracy for both the government and industry to develop strategies and policies in China. The model and database developed in this study can be used for analysis both at national and regional levels. This study did not include the energy use and GHG emissions in vehicle manufacturing stage. Although it is a small portion in the analysis, it could provide understanding of the difference in vehicle manufacturing process between EVs and traditional gasoline vehicles. This paper shows that the Common BEVs currently demonstrated are not a silver bullet for attacking energy consumption challenges and GHG emissions. In China context, full HEVs seem more attractive than Common BEVs to deal with energy security and GHG reduction challenge today. In order to achieve GHG reduction targets through vehicle electrification, China must promote CCS technology to help USC and IGCC power plants deliver low-carbon transportation energy on supply side. At the same time, High-efficient BEVs have to be set as the highest priority of automotive technology development. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",China; Electric vehicle; GHG emissions; Thermal power generation; Well-to-Wheel Analysis,Combined cycle power plants; Database systems; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Technology; Wheels; Automotive technology; Battery electric vehicles; China; Coal-fired electricity; Energy security; Energy use; Gasoline vehicle; Generation technologies; GHG emission; In-vehicle; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Low-carbon; Petrol consumption; Power generation technology; Reduction targets; Regional levels; Regulated emissions; Thermal power generation; Total energy; Well-to-wheel analysis; Greenhouse gases,,,"W.

This paper examines how electrified vehicles (EVs) can help reduce China's energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the future. Here EVs include hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), and battery electric vehicle (BEV). First, this study uses an Electricity Supply and Emissions Model to forecast the GHG emissions intensity factors of China's electric grid under three renewable generation adoption scenarios. Then, it uses a China FLEET model to project the stock, energy demand, and GHG emissions of the LDV fleet for different scenarios out to 2050. Results show that there is significant potential for electrification to reduce the energy demand, oil dependence, and GHG emissions of the LDV fleet, because of the high efficiency of EVs, and especially BEVs. Compared to growing the renewable energy contribution to the electricity supply system, expanding EVs in the fleet can occur faster, provided that they become more attractive relative to conventional gasoline vehicles. To help China reverse the rising trajectory of CO2 emissions by 2030, the aggressive EV scenario and the more-renewables electricity scenario will likely be needed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",China's in-use fleet; Electric vehicle; Energy consumption; GHG emissions; Model forecasting; Renewable electricity generation,China; Battery electric vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Vehicles; China's in-use fleet; Conventional gasoline; Electrified vehicles; GHG emission; Model forecasting; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Renewable electricity; Renewable generation; alternative energy; electric vehicle; emission control; energy efficiency; energy planning; energy policy; environmental impact; future prospect; greenhouse gas; Plug-in hybrid vehicles,,,S.J.

We need to supply all energy, not just electricity, from diverse renewable energy (RE) resources, both distributed and centralized, where the world's richest RE resources - of large geographic extent and high intensity - are stranded: far from end-users with inadequate or nonexistent gathering and transmission systems to deliver the energy. Electricity energy storage cannot affordably firm large, intermittent renewables at annual scale, while carbon-free gaseous hydrogen (GH2) and liquid anhydrous ammonia (NH3) fuels can, at < US$ 1.00 / kWh capital cost: GH2 in large solution-mined salt caverns, NH3 in surface tanks, both pressurized and refrigerated. Energy content of these fuels: 1 kg GH2 = 39.4 kWh (HHV) or 33.3 kWh (LHV) 1 kg NH3 = 6.3 kWh (HHV) or 5.2 kWh (LHV) Higher heating value (HHV) and lower heating value (LHV) of fuels differ by the heat of vaporization of water. We need to conceive, analyze, strategize, snd commit to building complete RE systems, from photons and moving air and water molecules to firm and dispatchable energy services delivered to distant end-users. Natural gas energy systems may be a better model than a ""smarter"" electricity grid. ""Smart Grid"" is emerging as primarily a DSM (demand side management) strategy to encourage energy conservation. Making the electricity grid ""smarter"" does not: 1. Increase physical transmission capacity; 2. Provide affordable annual-scale firming storage for RE; 3. Solve grid integration problem for large, time-varying RE; 4. Alleviate ""not in my back yard"" (NIMBY) objections to new transmission siting; 5. Reduce the high O&M costs of overhead electric lines. The ""smarter"" grid may be more vulnerable to cyberattack than today's grid. Adding storage, control, and power quality adjunct devices to the electricity grid, to accommodate very high RE content, may be technically and economically inferior to the GH2 and NH3 RE systems discussed here. Thus, we need to look beyond ""smart grid"", expanding our concept of ""transmission"", to synergistically and simultaneously solve the transmission, firming storage, and RE integration ""balancing"" problems now severely constraining our progress toward ""running the world on renewables"". Today's energy industry is very water-intensive, consuming ∼17,000 × 10∧9 liters of fresh water annually in USA. If total USA annual energy - from all sources, for all uses - were generated as RE-source electricity and converted to GH2 and / or NH3 fuels for transmission, total freshwater feedstock consumption, about one-fourth liter per kWh, would be ∼900 × 10∧9 liters per year. This is far less than ∼17,000 × 109 liters the USA energy sector ""consumed"" in 2005. For example, a 1,000 MW windplant, operating at 40% capacity factor (CF), producing ∼3,500 TWh (TWh = 109 kWh) per year, would consume ∼800 × 10∧6 liters of freshwater feedstock per year. Transportation electrification does not necessarily require battery electric vehicles (BEV's). GH2 and / or NH3 fuels would supply electric energy to the drive system via fuel cells, and may provide longer range at lower cost, greater energy security, and with better access to large, stranded, RE resources as annually-firm energy than an expanded and ""smarter"" electricity grid could provide. The energy industry now needs to conceive, design, bid, build, and operate pilot plants by which to discover and demonstrate the technical and economic advantages - if any - of RE-source GH2 and / or NH3 fuel transmission, storage, and delivery systems, as humanity urgently proceeds to ""run the world on renewables"".",,,,,,,,7365721,978-162276385-6,PGRCD,,English,Int.

This can be made possible with the integration of renewable energy (RE) sources (mostly solar and wind). However, Reintegration with conventional grids brings with it grid stability issues, unpredictable and unbalanced supply and demand curves, reverse power flows ultimately resulting in blackouts as conventional grids are not ready to handle Reintegration. This is due to intermittent, variable, non-predictable, and location-specific generation profiles of renewables. All these challenges can be addressed using smart grid solutions integrating information and communication technology infrastructure with electricity infrastructure and adding intelligence to the combination. Smart technologies that can be readily implementable to overcome the above-addressed challenges are detailed in the paper. Some of these are demand response with customer engagement through smart meters, prosumers—encouraging customer feeding back to grid during peak demand through rooftop renewables, RE microgrids to feed a particular boundary isolated from conventional grid, smart inverters which act as storage devices and can feed AC back to grid, integrated storage using battery electric vehicles (BEVs), dynamic line rating using PMUs for real-time and enhanced loading and protection of feeders, etc. Benefits added to the utility and consumers of these technologies are discussed in detail. Electric mobility of transport is another key focus area worldwide due to depleting primary fuels and environmental (GHG) concerns. Major challenge to a distribution utility is the increased demand of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and the charging infrastructure required for EVs. Smart solutions result in new business opportunities for distribution utilities using EV charging infrastructure and also benefit the customer through offering credit for feeding back to grid during peak hours and emergency islanding conditions. This is possible through smart integration of EV with conventional grid through two-way (electrical and information) communication between a distribution utility and consumer.

China has invested much to develop electric vehicle technologies. For EVs' penetration, China government develop 'ten-city one thousand-EVs' demonstration program in 25 cities from 2008. For mass penetration of EVs, there still exist many challenges, especially for electric car for private use. How to promote EVs application based on present electric powertrain technologies has become an urgent demand for China government. Targeting to propose a kind of comprehensive trade-off method and to get the optimized powertrain parameters, such as battery capacity, in this paper, the simulation models were setup in Matlab/Simulink. The energy consumption model was setup, and based on that model, electricity consumption efficiency of electric sedan under NEDC and China city passenger car driving cycle were analyzed and compared. Based on energy consumption of a conventional reference car and a BEV, a comprehensive trade-off method for the average car user is proposed targeting to China market. The method takes into account the traction battery technology status and forecasting, vehicle daily kilometers travel, operating duty cycle, purchase price, fixed annual costs and operating costs, policy of EVs, etc. By the analysis, it can be concluded that A-compact type BEV, the AER designed sweet region should be no more than 200km under weight constrain. With higher battery capacities the amortization time becomes significantly longer, but from the systematic view, it is the less economical. Based on above analysis, the most cost-benefit designed AER with 50km VKDT should be 80km from view of minimum TCO of life cycle. So the optimized installed battery capacity threshold based on China VKDT is highly recommended. And the subsidy policy for EV should be modified more reasonable. © 2013 IEEE.",all electric range; battery capacity; cost-benefit; electric cars; trade-off design,Costs; Depreciation; Economic and social effects; Electric automobiles; Energy security; Energy utilization; Life cycle; MATLAB; Operating costs; Powertrains; Secondary batteries; Battery capacity; Cost benefits; Electric cars; Electric range; Trade-off design; Cost benefit analysis,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-147993832-2,,,English,"World Electric Veh.

The development of eco-friendly vehicle technologies, such as electric and hydrogen vehicles, has increased. This article investigates whether hydrogen vehicles will replace electric vehicles in the future. The results showed that fuel-cell cars are unlikely to compete with electric cars. This is due to the advancements in electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, which are becoming more cost-effective and efficient. Additionally, the technical progress in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is expected to reduce the market share of fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) in passenger vehicles. However, significant investments have been made in hydrogen cars. Many ongoing investments seem to follow the sunk cost fallacy, where decision-makers continue to invest in an unprofitable project due to their already invested resources. Furthermore, even with megawatt charging, fuel-cell trucks cost more than battery-powered electric trucks. The use cases for fuel-cell electric trucks are also much more limited, as their running expenses are higher compared to electric cars. Hydrogen vehicles may be beneficial for heavy transport in remote areas. However, it remains to be seen if niche markets are large enough to support fuel-cell electric truck commercialization and economies of scale. In summary, we believe that hydrogen vehicles will not replace electric cars and trucks, at least before 2050. © 2023 by the authors.",electric cars and trucks; future transportation; hydrogen cars and trucks,Automobiles; Automotive industry; Charging (batteries); Climate change; Commerce; Competition; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Hydrogen; Investments; Secondary batteries; Trucks; Change costs; Electric cars; Electric truck; Energy cost; Future transportation; Growing demand; Hydrogen car; Hydrogen car and truck; Hydrogen vehicles; Toxic emissions; Fuel cells,"UAL-FEDER 2020, (UAL2020-TIC-A2080); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU, (PGC2018-098813-B-C33)","This research received support from the the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities under the programme “Proyectos de I+D de Generacion de Conocimiento” of the national programme for the generation of scientific and technological knowledge and strengthening of the R+D+I system through grant number PGC2018-098813-B-C33 and by UAL-FEDER 2020, Ref.

It finds that environmental and energy security pressures have created a favourable landscape ‘push’ for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) that in turn has encouraged and facilitated serious commitment from some manufacturers. Yet BEVs, as a niche product seeking to disrupt an entrenched and established regime, face significant multi-level forces acting as barriers against such a transition, which the paper explores. This combination of factors creates a situation where BEV market penetration remains far below the level required for mass market transition. For BEVs to ‘cross the chasm’ and gain an established foothold in the market and hence significantly disrupt the regime, more holistic and effective solutions are required. It is argued that, so far, this has yet to be fully taken on board by policy makers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Automobility; Barriers; Battery Electric Vehicles; Multi-Level Perspective; Transitions,Automobile manufacture; Automotive batteries; Commerce; Electron transitions; Energy security; Automobility; Barriers; Effective solution; Market penetration; Multilevels; Niche products; Policy makers; automobile; electric vehicle; perception; Battery electric vehicles,,,"N.

With the current heterogeneity of grid electricity mix in China, greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) vary dramatically with location. Currently, compared to baseline conventional gasoline vehicles, BEVs in north and northeastern Chinese provinces have very modest (∼10-20%) well-to-wheel (WTW) GHG benefits, whereas BEVs in southern provinces have substantial benefits (∼50%). With the expected transition to a more renewable electricity mix documented here, regional effects will largely disappear and the benefits of BEVs will be substantial (∼60-70% lower than current internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and ∼10-40% lower than 2030 advanced hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs)) across the whole of China by 2030. GHG emissions from BEVs in Chinese cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Pearl River Delta) and United States cities and regions (New York; Washington, DC; Chicago; New England; Texas; and California) in 2015 and 2030 are evaluated and compared. BEVs in Chinese cities will still have substantially higher WTW GHG emissions than those in New York, New England, and California in 2030. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,Beijing; California; Chicago; China; Cities; Electricity; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Motor Vehicles; New England; New York; Texas; United States; Vehicle Emissions; China; United States; Battery electric vehicles; Energy security; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; Vehicle-to-grid; Conventional gasoline; Electricity generation greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); Internal combustion engine vehicles; Pearl River delta; Regional effects; Renewable electricity; combustion; electric vehicle; electricity generation; electrification; emission; greenhouse gas; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; California; China; city; electricity; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; Illinois; motor vehicle; New York; Texas; United States; Hybrid vehicles,,,"W.

Up to 1/3 of the worldwide energy demand in 2050 can be saved by energy efficiency measures. In this chapter, several important aspects of energy efficiency are addressed. After an introduction and definition of energy efficiency, historic development and state-of-the-art and future trends of energy efficiency are presented in the light of life cycle assessment and total cost of ownership considerations. Energy efficiency in the sectors energy production, energy transmission and storage, transportation, industry, buildings, and appliances is reviewed. Concurrent measures such as recycling or novel materials are also discussed and touched upon. Energy conservation is covered in the final section of this chapter. References for deeper study are provided with an emphasis on guidelines on how to improve energy efficiency. Given the breadth of the subject, only exemplary coverage can be aimed for. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight the significance of energy efficiency and to provide cross-learnings from achievements in different sectors so that energy efficiency in the readers’ own facilities and installations can be assessed and improved with cost-effective means as a contribution to climate change mitigation, cost savings, and improved economic competitiveness. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 and Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",450 scenario (IEA);

However, the rollout of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) and hydrogen retail stations (HRS) requires substantial investments with high risks due to many uncertainties. We compare retail infrastructure costs on a common basis - cost per mile, assuming fueling service to 10% of all light-duty vehicles in a typical 1.5 million person city in 2025. Our analysis considers three HRS sizes, four distinct types of EVSE and two distinct EVSE scenarios. EVSE station costs, including equipment and installation, are assumed to be 15% less than today's costs. We find that levelized retail capital costs per mile are essentially indistinguishable given the uncertainty and variability around input assumptions. Total fuel costs per mile for battery electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) are, respectively, 21% lower and 13% lower than that for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) under the home-dominant scenario. Including fuel economies and vehicle costs makes FCEVs and BEVs comparable in terms of costs per mile, and PHEVs are about 10% less than FCEVs and BEVs. To account for geographic variability in energy prices and hydrogen delivery costs, we use the Scenario Evaluation, Regionalization and Analysis (SERA) model and confirm the aforementioned estimate of cost per mile, nationally averaged, and estimate a 15% variability in regional costs of FCEVs and a 5% variability in regional costs for BEVs.",,Battery electric vehicles; Costs; Economics; Energy security; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Plug-in electric vehicles; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Sales; Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE); Geographic variability; Infrastructure costs; Light duty vehicles; Social and environmental; Substantial investments; Transportation sector; Uncertainty and variability; Cost benefit analysis,,,"M.W.
